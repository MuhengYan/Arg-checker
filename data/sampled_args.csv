1,COVID's Impact,COVID's Impact on Daily Life,assumption,"The coronavirus crisis has taught us an overdue lesson about work : we have learned what kinds matter . Workers the government just one month ago designated “ low - skilled ” are now “ key workers ” , including supermarket and warehouse workers , carers , cleaners , couriers , bus drivers and refuse collectors . Many of these workforces have been transformed over the past decade by the gig economy and corporate outsourcing , leaving them highly precarious and poorly waged . Yet these are the workers that keep society going . The government , it seems , has not gotten the memo . Rishi Sunak ’ s wage bailout did not initially even include self - employed or gig economy workers . The self - employed rescue package the chancellor eventually delivered on Thursday will not come into effect until June , rendering it entirely inadequate for a workforce that largely lives hand - to - mouth . The package does not include sick pay , nor does it extend to those who have recently joined the gig economy , or anyone who earns less than fifty per cent of their income through gig work . The package also requires workers to calculate their average profit from gig work from the past three years , a significant administrative burden on those with little free time . Profit is also an unfair way to calculate eligibility , as it does not factor in expenses , like insurance costs . Simply put , the package does not reflect how gig workers actually work . This oversight is not unique to this government . It is the culmination of decades of companies running roughshod over workers ’ rights , of governments refusing to listen to workers and establish policies that recognise the realities of gig life . This historic shortfall makes it all the less surprising that during a crisis , the government has failed these workers yet again – despite being essential to surviving this pandemic . The government is exacerbating the crisis by putting key workers at risk , and failing to properly resource them at this crucial time . Gig workers are not even being afforded what little rights workers have left . The wild success of companies like Deliveroo relies on their not offering conventional worker entitlements like holiday pay , sick pay or professional insurance , let alone a minimum wage . These platforms hide behind claims their workers are self - employed or independent contractors , rather than employees – despite having the same , and in some cases more , control over their workers than a traditional employer . Companies also use this claim to circumvent labour laws ; workers can be hired and fired instantly and without explanation . Such legal loopholes are critical to the business models of companies like Uber , which saves up to 30 % on labour costs by exploiting them . It is no secret that these workforces are disproportionately comprised of migrants and those from migrant backgrounds , making them more easily exploitable . Governments and companies can get away with poorer treatment of the socially marginalised , because the rest of society is less likely to vote or act in solidarity with them . An increasingly unequal world and draconian immigration policies mean migrants have fewer employment options than ever , forcing them into working conditions unacceptable to the rest of the workforce . Their economic exploitation is made easier by their political and social disenfranchisement . So people working as couriers , taxi drivers , care workers , cleaners and in warehouses are being locked out of crucial safety nets because they are not legally defined as employees . These workers are also often separated from their colleagues and made to bear the brunt of operational costs and labour . In short , the “ self - employed ” label that the gig economy relies on overburdens and isolates already struggling workers . We are seeing these shortfalls manifest now with devastating consequences . Workers who should be self - isolating , some of whom may even have symptoms , are going to work , because government wage relief is not coming for months . Others do not qualify for relief , as the irregularities of gig work make meeting the threshold for access unrealistic for most workers . Many gig workers are also part - time , relying on gigs to make up to fifty per cent of their livelihood . These workers will also get no help from the government , and so will see up to half of their income slashed . This lack of recognition of the realities of gig work will not only have severe economic impacts on workers – it will put their lives and those of others at risk , as workers are forced to go against public health advice to survive . Read our full mailing list consent terms here In the short term , the government must provide a safety net for all , without exceptions . In the long term , it must develop labour policies in the interests of workers , rather than sustaining a broken , exploitative business model . We are all staked in what happens to gig workers during this crisis – not only because they are essential to addressing it , but because what starts at the margins of society rarely ends there . Academia , for example – once seen as the quintessential stable , middle - class profession – is increasingly taking on the casualised working practices of the gig economy . This pandemic has been a harsh warning against taking for granted the workers who sustain our economy . Let the lesson be solidarity – the only weapon we have against exploitation .",B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption

1,COVID's Impact,COVID's Economy Impact,assumption,"On the other side of the ledger are sectors that continue to be restricted , by law for public safety , and which have a stronger case to continue receiving state support . Many businesses , particularly smaller ones , are struggling for reasons outside of their control . Low - wage occupations , and those in entry level positions that have been hardest hit , and all the sectors you expect like hotels and restaurants and retail . In the next stage of this crisis , as the economy reopens , the Chancellor should take steps to make it easier to hire , invest and grow businesses . It has been mooted that the Chancellor could offer a holiday for employers ’ National Insurance contributions . While this may sound like a good idea , it could create the wrong incentives . It could encourage businesses to get rid of the old and bring in the new at lower cost . It penalises firms that have done the right thing in keeping people on their books , and it breaks the successful link of corporate welfare during this crisis being tied to the ongoing goal of high employment . A simpler response would be to raise the threshold for national insurance payments to be made by companies . Employers currently pay National Insurance of URLTOKEN percent on every pound the employee earns over £7 , 488 with no cap . If the Government wants to encourage firms to hire , they should immediately fast track raising the bottom threshold for employer ’ s National Insurance to £12 , 500 . That would reward all firms that are looking to hire and make it cheaper to keep existing workers on the books as the furlough scheme finishes . Corporate welfare is an ugly idea . If it must be done though , it should be employee - focused for companies that have faced and continue to face restrictions . In the next phase we could borrow from Australia ’ s ‘ JobKeeper ’ allowance that pays a set amount for all employees who work for businesses that have had a substantial reduction in revenue . In the longer run , we could use Universal Credit to top - up those in work until all restrictions on trading are removed . Let ’ s be up front ; it ’ s a subsidy , but it ’ s a subsidy because the political cost of removing the regulation is costing businesses so much in the first place — and it continues to retain productive capacity for firms that are held back against their will . A jobs guarantee seems like a lovely suggestion but in practice , it could mean creating non - jobs that compete with private employers and siphon money off to firms . Better to ensure that value is actually being added . While a wage subsidy keeps jobs in place that provide lower value than they return given costs , a guarantee locks people in jobs and continues costs to companies even where there is no value at all to a position ’ s existence . It can create an ugly workplace culture — in Japan and even New York ’ s public school system , it has meant adults languishing in rooms for months and years with nothing to do and no prospects to moving on . There are alternatives to guarantees too . Namely , smashing state restrictions that hold back innovations and new enterprise . Businesses that make the mistake of employing five or more people are currently handed a raft of health and safety regulations they have to comply with , but are still called micro - businesses by the state with under 10 employees . We can double the number of employees before health and safety manuals and fire wardens with clipboards are hired — we ’ ll create thousands more viable businesses overnight . With thousands of businesses likely to go under , we need to be sure that we make it as easy as possible for their replacements to emerge . Central government should overrule the petty bureaucracy in your local council . We ’ ve seen flexibility in this approach allow restaurants and pubs to serve as takeaways and shops . Let ’ s go further and get rid of every silly license on the number of dogs people can walk , which shops can open at what times , who can clean a window , even whether your business can cut hair or not — I certainly need the barbers after three months inside . The Treasury can meet its manifesto commitments of not raising taxes , and levelling up the country , by making it cheaper to invest in new businesses , ensuring the costs to new businesses starting up are smaller and making it cheaper to employ people . That way lies growth , that way lies a more prosperous future and , over time , that way lies more revenue for the taxman to repay the debts he ’ s incurring on our behalf .",B-assumption I-assumption

1,COVID's Impact,COVID's Economy Impact,assumption,"It takes a special kind of talent to engineer an economic war with China at the same time as we are leaving the EU single market – and to do so right in the middle of a pandemic and the sharpest recession in 300 years . Far from being some beacon of global free trade , Britain will soon have no such free trade agreements with any of its largest ( actual or potential ) economic partners – Europe , America , Japan , India – or , now , China . Allowing for exchange rate distortions , China is the biggest economy on the planet and Britain is an open economy that makes its living from trade . This is really no time for the UK to come over all Sinophobic . The barely concealed anger of the Chinese authorities confirms that the ban on Huawei will have consequences . That much is predictable , and it will not be good news for Britain . From electric vehicle technology , to the City , to nuclear power , as well as the 5G network , Chinese investment has been hugely beneficial , mutually so . Now the Chinese feel they can not trust the British . Why would any country ’ s companies now commit billions in investment to Britain when plans and assumptions can be torn up so casually ? The Japanese , whose efforts ( in money and expertise ) helped to transform so much of British manufacturing , were predicated on EU membership – have still not recovered from the shock of Brexit . Now it is the turn of the Chinese to feel let down . We are told that Britain can not trust Huawei , controlled as it is by its government and thus the Chinese Communist Party . China is increasingly called a “ hostile power ” with malign intentions towards Britain . Where is the evidence for this ? Where , exactly , do our interests conflict ? Are the Chinese plotting to invade Britain ? More to the point , is it true that using Huawei software or hardware or “ non core ” component actually compromises personal data or national security ? How ? Where ’ s the evidence for that ? What are the mechanisms whereby the Chinese spies can snoop on us ? No one has yet published any kind of dossier , dodgy or otherwise , on China ’ s supposed methods of future mass espionage . Read our full mailing list consent terms here Could it be , perhaps , that parts of the Conservative Party have been seized by an attack of Sinophobia ? The government has been panicked by a potential defeat at the hands of rebel backbenchers – mostly Eurosceptics , now virally mutating into Sinosceptics . The paranoia – but nothing else – is real . It is strongly reminiscent of previous episodes of Sinophobia , such as the late - Victorian panic about supposed Chinese - run opium dens and a sinister slave trade in the East End of London . The usual racial stereotypes and slurs about untrustworthy Chinese seem to be emerging once again , this time directed against a company that happens to make phones . There are still people out there who really do think the Chinese invented the novel coronavirus that causes Covid - 19 in a lab in Wuhan and then unleashed it on the west in another bid for world domination . Some of those people are in the White House , and call it “ kung flu ” . Some are Tory MPs . It is certainly true that the People ’ s Republic of China is no paradise for human rights . Britain has to try and stand up for Hong Kong , legally and morally – and , for that matter , the Uighur Muslims , the Tibetans and anyone across the People ’ s Republic who is persecuted . Yes , China is a known routine abuser of human rights , but will banning Huawei in Britain actually make matters better or worse ? It could conceivably make things even more difficult for the people of Hong Kong , so rapid has the relationship between the UK and China deteriorated . Militarily there is nothing that can be done by the British to protect the people of Hong Kong , and , in fact , even when it was still part of the British empire . The British were fortunate that the Red Guards or People ’ s Liberation Army never walked in and reclaimed it during that period . Comically , the navy is to send an aircraft carrier , HMS Queen Elizabeth to the South China Sea , to show Beijing we mean business : gunboat diplomacy . Maybe the Chinese secret service will be able to find out whether there are yet any aircraft on our aircraft carrier ? It is not obvious , at any rate , that chucking Huawei out of the plan for Britain ’ s 5G roll out will make the Chinese politburo relent over Hong Kong ’ s repressive new laws ; that we know . The truth is that there is a superpower rivalry between America and China and Britain is caught in the crossfire . We are being bullied , not by the Chinese but by the Americans , to take sides in their tech - trade war with Beijing , even thought this is not in the British national interest . A bunch of unbalanced Tory backbenchers are pushing our government around . We are going to have mobile phone outages , weak and outdated telecoms , and lower national productivity , just to please Donald Trump – who himself might be gone in a few months .",B-assumption

1,COVID's Impact,COVID's Global Impact,assumption,"The pandemic has exposed a web of inequalities across our society and economy . These inequalities demonstrate the urgent need for an industrial strategy that puts workers at its heart . We need an agenda that not only ` ` levels up ' ' the struggling parts of our country , as Boris Johnson puts it , but one that also ensures the millions of workers who have been left behind for years - and who are now facing the brunt of the Covid - 19 recession - get the support they deserve . Sadly , despite the prime minister ' s ` ` new deal ' ' for the economy , that ' s not on the cards . Many of the problems these workers are facing have been around for years , but Covid - 19 has acted as a catalyst . Whether or not you could access the government ’ s income support schemes , were a key worker , or were able to work from home , has meant a stark divide in experiences of the crisis , but the differences in how we value work are not new . Indeed , these divides are ones that have been developing across our country for years . These inequalities were exposed by the crisis , but they will only get worse if we do not act now . There is a way to make a change - by building a balanced , sustainable , innovative economy fit for the 21st century . Important work on this is already being done ; Britain is leading the way in green energy and is racing towards its goal of carbon net zero by 2050 . As it stands , however , the government ’ s ` ` levelling up ' ' agenda is yet to be demonstrated and our industrial strategy lacks both ambition and scope . Its failing is that it forgets our greatest asset : the British people . If workers are at the heart of a revitalised industrial strategy , then we can build an economy and society stronger than the one that entered the crisis . To do this we need to prioritise three areas . First , we need a coordinated push by businesses and government to provide the support and training that workers need to thrive . If we want a highly skilled , high earning economy , we need to provide the education and environment that will make it a reality . Second , workers who already contribute a huge amount to our society should be valued and given the recognition they deserve . And finally , we need a new era of social partnerships involving workers , unions , employers , and government . Britain faced a skills crisis before the pandemic , and that crisis is even more urgent now . Tackling it requires coordination between government and business to prioritise the most pressing areas for retraining . However , we must also encourage government and businesses to engage with workers to find out what they believe will help in their current roles and longer term working lives . It is only by partnering with workers that we can expect to retool our economy for the globalising , automating , post Covid - 19 world . Read our full mailing list consent terms here The pandemic has also demonstrated just how essential our neglected key workers are . Many of these jobs were previously dismissed as ` ` low skilled ' ' . However , the flexibility , courage and compassion that key workers have shown during the coronavirus pandemic has proved , finally , that this is a false distinction . We can not have a thriving economy that continues to undervalue the workers which form its foundation . Only a complete rethink on how we reward and value work will we close the cracks that run through our economy . The urgent response to the outbreak of coronavirus , and the closing down of the economy , has shown just what can be achieved when government , businesses and trade unions work together , from the introduction of the furlough and self - employment schemes to the guidance on safety at work . Rebuilding our economy in a way that works for everyone is a challenge that requires a continued commitment to this kind of social partnership long after the spectre of coronavirus has passed . The challenges we face now are only going to get harder to tackle if we do not act . However , they are challenges that can be faced with a revitalised industry strategy that includes everyone . We all have a role to play in building a Britain for the 21st century . We face a choice as to whether we continue to muddle through with increasing inequality and a fracturing society ; or seize the opportunity to rebuild our economy in a way that leaves no one behind . If we are to take the latter route we will emerge from this crisis with a new perspective and mission . One that recognises the importance of working with people , in order to build a country that works for people .",B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption

1,COVID's Impact,COVID's Impact at School,assumption,"“ Advisors advise , ministers decide , ” goes the saying . During this current pandemic , ministers are falling over themselves to tell anyone who ’ ll listen that they ’ re being led by the science . It provides both an easy justification for whatever they ’ ve decided to date and perhaps a temptingly convenient scapegoat if any decision turns out to have been wrong . The comments of Therese Coffey , the secretary of state of work and pensions , about “ wrong science ” are merely the most recent example . This clearing the path for a scapegoat has actually been going on for weeks . The media is awash with half - baked commentary from a repeating handful of backbench MPs , peers and businesspeople , pointing out the flaws in models that are being used to inform government policy making . Nobody who knows anything about mathematical modelling will be the slightest bit surprised by the existence of such flaws . Indeed , members of Sage will be fully conscious of them when they provide their advice to politicians . But the existence of flaws is now being used in attempts to gaslight the public , which undermines the overriding public health message that has curtailed freedoms and shuttered businesses . At a time when it ’ s critical for public and national safety that people trust the advice provided to them by those in authority , it is exceptionally dangerous to cast around non - specific criticisms of the science . As a chemist , Dr Coffey would be better advised to explain how science works , how the evidence is gathered and how it is then interpreted in order to help guide policy . Medical science ’ s rudimentary understanding of this new coronavirus , which nobody had heard of six months ago , mean that uncertainty is inevitable ; our understanding of it and how it affects the human body is constantly evolving . In such a fast - moving situation , it ’ s inevitable that data will frequently be uncertain and incomplete , if it exists at all . Scientists often disagree in their interpretation of data – it ’ s one of the frustrating yet essential aspects of how science works . Scientific advice is usually heavily caveated , and it is the responsibility of politicians and elected leaders to make decisions and formulate policy . There are numerous instances in the current emergency where our understanding has been patchy : the number of people who ’ ve been infected by the virus ; why some people are more vulnerable to disease than others ; how effective wearing face masks might be for the general population ; and whether someone who ’ s recovered from the virus will be immune to subsequent infection . Read our full mailing list consent terms here Over - confident assertions are sometimes made by politicians wanting to look authoritative and in control . But in this pandemic , they ’ re made on the basis of a nascent understanding , which may change . To scientists , this is nothing to worry about ; science is a process , not a finished body of knowledge , and they embrace this uncertainty , using it to drive forward the acquisition of knowledge . Changing advice as our understanding improves is not something to apologise for – it ’ s proof of better understanding . There is an anxiety among some in the scientific community that this daily national drama , with its storyline played out on our TV screens , is making science out to be something that it is not : a sure thing . Presented through a prism of ministerial media briefings and Prime Minister ’ s Questions , science can appear as just another political tool , a force to drive decision - making along with opinion polls and public sentiment . And it really isn ’ t the same . Science has never been so important , and so high - profile . Yet politicians should be careful . Criticising “ wrong science ” for decisions of government that lead to less than perfect outcomes – and , let ’ s be clear , that means people dying – can start to look like deflection of blame . Right now , we can not afford to find our own , more convenient , “ alternative facts ” . Post - truth tactics may be advantageous for politicians , but for public health during a pandemic , they are potentially lethal .",B-assumption B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption

0,COVID's Impact,COVID's Impact on Daily Life,assumption,"The coronavirus crisis has taught us an overdue lesson about work : we have learned what kinds matter . Workers the government just one month ago designated “ low - skilled ” are now “ key workers ” , including supermarket and warehouse workers , carers , cleaners , couriers , bus drivers and refuse collectors . Many of these workforces have been transformed over the past decade by the gig economy and corporate outsourcing , leaving them highly precarious and poorly waged . Yet these are the workers that keep society going . The government , it seems , has not gotten the memo . Rishi Sunak ’ s wage bailout did not initially even include self - employed or gig economy workers . The self - employed rescue package the chancellor eventually delivered on Thursday will not come into effect until June , rendering it entirely inadequate for a workforce that largely lives hand - to - mouth . The package does not include sick pay , nor does it extend to those who have recently joined the gig economy , or anyone who earns less than fifty per cent of their income through gig work . The package also requires workers to calculate their average profit from gig work from the past three years , a significant administrative burden on those with little free time . Profit is also an unfair way to calculate eligibility , as it does not factor in expenses , like insurance costs . Simply put , the package does not reflect how gig workers actually work . This oversight is not unique to this government . It is the culmination of decades of companies running roughshod over workers ’ rights , of governments refusing to listen to workers and establish policies that recognise the realities of gig life . This historic shortfall makes it all the less surprising that during a crisis , the government has failed these workers yet again – despite being essential to surviving this pandemic . The government is exacerbating the crisis by putting key workers at risk , and failing to properly resource them at this crucial time . Gig workers are not even being afforded what little rights workers have left . The wild success of companies like Deliveroo relies on their not offering conventional worker entitlements like holiday pay , sick pay or professional insurance , let alone a minimum wage . These platforms hide behind claims their workers are self - employed or independent contractors , rather than employees – despite having the same , and in some cases more , control over their workers than a traditional employer . Companies also use this claim to circumvent labour laws ; workers can be hired and fired instantly and without explanation . Such legal loopholes are critical to the business models of companies like Uber , which saves up to 30 % on labour costs by exploiting them . It is no secret that these workforces are disproportionately comprised of migrants and those from migrant backgrounds , making them more easily exploitable . Governments and companies can get away with poorer treatment of the socially marginalised , because the rest of society is less likely to vote or act in solidarity with them . An increasingly unequal world and draconian immigration policies mean migrants have fewer employment options than ever , forcing them into working conditions unacceptable to the rest of the workforce . Their economic exploitation is made easier by their political and social disenfranchisement . So people working as couriers , taxi drivers , care workers , cleaners and in warehouses are being locked out of crucial safety nets because they are not legally defined as employees . These workers are also often separated from their colleagues and made to bear the brunt of operational costs and labour . In short , the “ self - employed ” label that the gig economy relies on overburdens and isolates already struggling workers . We are seeing these shortfalls manifest now with devastating consequences . Workers who should be self - isolating , some of whom may even have symptoms , are going to work , because government wage relief is not coming for months . Others do not qualify for relief , as the irregularities of gig work make meeting the threshold for access unrealistic for most workers . Many gig workers are also part - time , relying on gigs to make up to fifty per cent of their livelihood . These workers will also get no help from the government , and so will see up to half of their income slashed . This lack of recognition of the realities of gig work will not only have severe economic impacts on workers – it will put their lives and those of others at risk , as workers are forced to go against public health advice to survive . Read our full mailing list consent terms here In the short term , the government must provide a safety net for all , without exceptions . In the long term , it must develop labour policies in the interests of workers , rather than sustaining a broken , exploitative business model . We are all staked in what happens to gig workers during this crisis – not only because they are essential to addressing it , but because what starts at the margins of society rarely ends there . Academia , for example – once seen as the quintessential stable , middle - class profession – is increasingly taking on the casualised working practices of the gig economy . This pandemic has been a harsh warning against taking for granted the workers who sustain our economy . Let the lesson be solidarity – the only weapon we have against exploitation .",B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption

0,COVID's Impact,COVID's Economy Impact,assumption,"On the other side of the ledger are sectors that continue to be restricted , by law for public safety , and which have a stronger case to continue receiving state support . Many businesses , particularly smaller ones , are struggling for reasons outside of their control . Low - wage occupations , and those in entry level positions that have been hardest hit , and all the sectors you expect like hotels and restaurants and retail . In the next stage of this crisis , as the economy reopens , the Chancellor should take steps to make it easier to hire , invest and grow businesses . It has been mooted that the Chancellor could offer a holiday for employers ’ National Insurance contributions . While this may sound like a good idea , it could create the wrong incentives . It could encourage businesses to get rid of the old and bring in the new at lower cost . It penalises firms that have done the right thing in keeping people on their books , and it breaks the successful link of corporate welfare during this crisis being tied to the ongoing goal of high employment . A simpler response would be to raise the threshold for national insurance payments to be made by companies . Employers currently pay National Insurance of URLTOKEN percent on every pound the employee earns over £7 , 488 with no cap . If the Government wants to encourage firms to hire , they should immediately fast track raising the bottom threshold for employer ’ s National Insurance to £12 , 500 . That would reward all firms that are looking to hire and make it cheaper to keep existing workers on the books as the furlough scheme finishes . Corporate welfare is an ugly idea . If it must be done though , it should be employee - focused for companies that have faced and continue to face restrictions . In the next phase we could borrow from Australia ’ s ‘ JobKeeper ’ allowance that pays a set amount for all employees who work for businesses that have had a substantial reduction in revenue . In the longer run , we could use Universal Credit to top - up those in work until all restrictions on trading are removed . Let ’ s be up front ; it ’ s a subsidy , but it ’ s a subsidy because the political cost of removing the regulation is costing businesses so much in the first place — and it continues to retain productive capacity for firms that are held back against their will . A jobs guarantee seems like a lovely suggestion but in practice , it could mean creating non - jobs that compete with private employers and siphon money off to firms . Better to ensure that value is actually being added . While a wage subsidy keeps jobs in place that provide lower value than they return given costs , a guarantee locks people in jobs and continues costs to companies even where there is no value at all to a position ’ s existence . It can create an ugly workplace culture — in Japan and even New York ’ s public school system , it has meant adults languishing in rooms for months and years with nothing to do and no prospects to moving on . There are alternatives to guarantees too . Namely , smashing state restrictions that hold back innovations and new enterprise . Businesses that make the mistake of employing five or more people are currently handed a raft of health and safety regulations they have to comply with , but are still called micro - businesses by the state with under 10 employees . We can double the number of employees before health and safety manuals and fire wardens with clipboards are hired — we ’ ll create thousands more viable businesses overnight . With thousands of businesses likely to go under , we need to be sure that we make it as easy as possible for their replacements to emerge . Central government should overrule the petty bureaucracy in your local council . We ’ ve seen flexibility in this approach allow restaurants and pubs to serve as takeaways and shops . Let ’ s go further and get rid of every silly license on the number of dogs people can walk , which shops can open at what times , who can clean a window , even whether your business can cut hair or not — I certainly need the barbers after three months inside . The Treasury can meet its manifesto commitments of not raising taxes , and levelling up the country , by making it cheaper to invest in new businesses , ensuring the costs to new businesses starting up are smaller and making it cheaper to employ people . That way lies growth , that way lies a more prosperous future and , over time , that way lies more revenue for the taxman to repay the debts he ’ s incurring on our behalf .",B-assumption I-assumption

0,COVID's Impact,COVID's Economy Impact,assumption,"It takes a special kind of talent to engineer an economic war with China at the same time as we are leaving the EU single market – and to do so right in the middle of a pandemic and the sharpest recession in 300 years . Far from being some beacon of global free trade , Britain will soon have no such free trade agreements with any of its largest ( actual or potential ) economic partners – Europe , America , Japan , India – or , now , China . Allowing for exchange rate distortions , China is the biggest economy on the planet and Britain is an open economy that makes its living from trade . This is really no time for the UK to come over all Sinophobic . The barely concealed anger of the Chinese authorities confirms that the ban on Huawei will have consequences . That much is predictable , and it will not be good news for Britain . From electric vehicle technology , to the City , to nuclear power , as well as the 5G network , Chinese investment has been hugely beneficial , mutually so . Now the Chinese feel they can not trust the British . Why would any country ’ s companies now commit billions in investment to Britain when plans and assumptions can be torn up so casually ? The Japanese , whose efforts ( in money and expertise ) helped to transform so much of British manufacturing , were predicated on EU membership – have still not recovered from the shock of Brexit . Now it is the turn of the Chinese to feel let down . We are told that Britain can not trust Huawei , controlled as it is by its government and thus the Chinese Communist Party . China is increasingly called a “ hostile power ” with malign intentions towards Britain . Where is the evidence for this ? Where , exactly , do our interests conflict ? Are the Chinese plotting to invade Britain ? More to the point , is it true that using Huawei software or hardware or “ non core ” component actually compromises personal data or national security ? How ? Where ’ s the evidence for that ? What are the mechanisms whereby the Chinese spies can snoop on us ? No one has yet published any kind of dossier , dodgy or otherwise , on China ’ s supposed methods of future mass espionage . Read our full mailing list consent terms here Could it be , perhaps , that parts of the Conservative Party have been seized by an attack of Sinophobia ? The government has been panicked by a potential defeat at the hands of rebel backbenchers – mostly Eurosceptics , now virally mutating into Sinosceptics . The paranoia – but nothing else – is real . It is strongly reminiscent of previous episodes of Sinophobia , such as the late - Victorian panic about supposed Chinese - run opium dens and a sinister slave trade in the East End of London . The usual racial stereotypes and slurs about untrustworthy Chinese seem to be emerging once again , this time directed against a company that happens to make phones . There are still people out there who really do think the Chinese invented the novel coronavirus that causes Covid - 19 in a lab in Wuhan and then unleashed it on the west in another bid for world domination . Some of those people are in the White House , and call it “ kung flu ” . Some are Tory MPs . It is certainly true that the People ’ s Republic of China is no paradise for human rights . Britain has to try and stand up for Hong Kong , legally and morally – and , for that matter , the Uighur Muslims , the Tibetans and anyone across the People ’ s Republic who is persecuted . Yes , China is a known routine abuser of human rights , but will banning Huawei in Britain actually make matters better or worse ? It could conceivably make things even more difficult for the people of Hong Kong , so rapid has the relationship between the UK and China deteriorated . Militarily there is nothing that can be done by the British to protect the people of Hong Kong , and , in fact , even when it was still part of the British empire . The British were fortunate that the Red Guards or People ’ s Liberation Army never walked in and reclaimed it during that period . Comically , the navy is to send an aircraft carrier , HMS Queen Elizabeth to the South China Sea , to show Beijing we mean business : gunboat diplomacy . Maybe the Chinese secret service will be able to find out whether there are yet any aircraft on our aircraft carrier ? It is not obvious , at any rate , that chucking Huawei out of the plan for Britain ’ s 5G roll out will make the Chinese politburo relent over Hong Kong ’ s repressive new laws ; that we know . The truth is that there is a superpower rivalry between America and China and Britain is caught in the crossfire . We are being bullied , not by the Chinese but by the Americans , to take sides in their tech - trade war with Beijing , even thought this is not in the British national interest . A bunch of unbalanced Tory backbenchers are pushing our government around . We are going to have mobile phone outages , weak and outdated telecoms , and lower national productivity , just to please Donald Trump – who himself might be gone in a few months .",B-assumption

0,COVID's Impact,COVID's Global Impact,assumption,"The pandemic has exposed a web of inequalities across our society and economy . These inequalities demonstrate the urgent need for an industrial strategy that puts workers at its heart . We need an agenda that not only ` ` levels up ' ' the struggling parts of our country , as Boris Johnson puts it , but one that also ensures the millions of workers who have been left behind for years - and who are now facing the brunt of the Covid - 19 recession - get the support they deserve . Sadly , despite the prime minister ' s ` ` new deal ' ' for the economy , that ' s not on the cards . Many of the problems these workers are facing have been around for years , but Covid - 19 has acted as a catalyst . Whether or not you could access the government ’ s income support schemes , were a key worker , or were able to work from home , has meant a stark divide in experiences of the crisis , but the differences in how we value work are not new . Indeed , these divides are ones that have been developing across our country for years . These inequalities were exposed by the crisis , but they will only get worse if we do not act now . There is a way to make a change - by building a balanced , sustainable , innovative economy fit for the 21st century . Important work on this is already being done ; Britain is leading the way in green energy and is racing towards its goal of carbon net zero by 2050 . As it stands , however , the government ’ s ` ` levelling up ' ' agenda is yet to be demonstrated and our industrial strategy lacks both ambition and scope . Its failing is that it forgets our greatest asset : the British people . If workers are at the heart of a revitalised industrial strategy , then we can build an economy and society stronger than the one that entered the crisis . To do this we need to prioritise three areas . First , we need a coordinated push by businesses and government to provide the support and training that workers need to thrive . If we want a highly skilled , high earning economy , we need to provide the education and environment that will make it a reality . Second , workers who already contribute a huge amount to our society should be valued and given the recognition they deserve . And finally , we need a new era of social partnerships involving workers , unions , employers , and government . Britain faced a skills crisis before the pandemic , and that crisis is even more urgent now . Tackling it requires coordination between government and business to prioritise the most pressing areas for retraining . However , we must also encourage government and businesses to engage with workers to find out what they believe will help in their current roles and longer term working lives . It is only by partnering with workers that we can expect to retool our economy for the globalising , automating , post Covid - 19 world . Read our full mailing list consent terms here The pandemic has also demonstrated just how essential our neglected key workers are . Many of these jobs were previously dismissed as ` ` low skilled ' ' . However , the flexibility , courage and compassion that key workers have shown during the coronavirus pandemic has proved , finally , that this is a false distinction . We can not have a thriving economy that continues to undervalue the workers which form its foundation . Only a complete rethink on how we reward and value work will we close the cracks that run through our economy . The urgent response to the outbreak of coronavirus , and the closing down of the economy , has shown just what can be achieved when government , businesses and trade unions work together , from the introduction of the furlough and self - employment schemes to the guidance on safety at work . Rebuilding our economy in a way that works for everyone is a challenge that requires a continued commitment to this kind of social partnership long after the spectre of coronavirus has passed . The challenges we face now are only going to get harder to tackle if we do not act . However , they are challenges that can be faced with a revitalised industry strategy that includes everyone . We all have a role to play in building a Britain for the 21st century . We face a choice as to whether we continue to muddle through with increasing inequality and a fracturing society ; or seize the opportunity to rebuild our economy in a way that leaves no one behind . If we are to take the latter route we will emerge from this crisis with a new perspective and mission . One that recognises the importance of working with people , in order to build a country that works for people .",B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption

0,COVID's Impact,COVID's Impact at School,assumption,"“ Advisors advise , ministers decide , ” goes the saying . During this current pandemic , ministers are falling over themselves to tell anyone who ’ ll listen that they ’ re being led by the science . It provides both an easy justification for whatever they ’ ve decided to date and perhaps a temptingly convenient scapegoat if any decision turns out to have been wrong . The comments of Therese Coffey , the secretary of state of work and pensions , about “ wrong science ” are merely the most recent example . This clearing the path for a scapegoat has actually been going on for weeks . The media is awash with half - baked commentary from a repeating handful of backbench MPs , peers and businesspeople , pointing out the flaws in models that are being used to inform government policy making . Nobody who knows anything about mathematical modelling will be the slightest bit surprised by the existence of such flaws . Indeed , members of Sage will be fully conscious of them when they provide their advice to politicians . But the existence of flaws is now being used in attempts to gaslight the public , which undermines the overriding public health message that has curtailed freedoms and shuttered businesses . At a time when it ’ s critical for public and national safety that people trust the advice provided to them by those in authority , it is exceptionally dangerous to cast around non - specific criticisms of the science . As a chemist , Dr Coffey would be better advised to explain how science works , how the evidence is gathered and how it is then interpreted in order to help guide policy . Medical science ’ s rudimentary understanding of this new coronavirus , which nobody had heard of six months ago , mean that uncertainty is inevitable ; our understanding of it and how it affects the human body is constantly evolving . In such a fast - moving situation , it ’ s inevitable that data will frequently be uncertain and incomplete , if it exists at all . Scientists often disagree in their interpretation of data – it ’ s one of the frustrating yet essential aspects of how science works . Scientific advice is usually heavily caveated , and it is the responsibility of politicians and elected leaders to make decisions and formulate policy . There are numerous instances in the current emergency where our understanding has been patchy : the number of people who ’ ve been infected by the virus ; why some people are more vulnerable to disease than others ; how effective wearing face masks might be for the general population ; and whether someone who ’ s recovered from the virus will be immune to subsequent infection . Read our full mailing list consent terms here Over - confident assertions are sometimes made by politicians wanting to look authoritative and in control . But in this pandemic , they ’ re made on the basis of a nascent understanding , which may change . To scientists , this is nothing to worry about ; science is a process , not a finished body of knowledge , and they embrace this uncertainty , using it to drive forward the acquisition of knowledge . Changing advice as our understanding improves is not something to apologise for – it ’ s proof of better understanding . There is an anxiety among some in the scientific community that this daily national drama , with its storyline played out on our TV screens , is making science out to be something that it is not : a sure thing . Presented through a prism of ministerial media briefings and Prime Minister ’ s Questions , science can appear as just another political tool , a force to drive decision - making along with opinion polls and public sentiment . And it really isn ’ t the same . Science has never been so important , and so high - profile . Yet politicians should be careful . Criticising “ wrong science ” for decisions of government that lead to less than perfect outcomes – and , let ’ s be clear , that means people dying – can start to look like deflection of blame . Right now , we can not afford to find our own , more convenient , “ alternative facts ” . Post - truth tactics may be advantageous for politicians , but for public health during a pandemic , they are potentially lethal .",B-assumption B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption

1,COVID's Impact,COVID's Impact on Daily Life,testimony,"Public Health England ' s approach to coronavirus has been ` ` totally negligent ' ' , according to a leading specialist , who also suggests the agency wasted resources by helping overseas . Dr John Ashton , the former director of public health in the North West , says he was concerned by an increasing workload which should have been left to the Department for International Development ( Dfid ) . Long - haul air miles carried out by staff almost doubled - from URLTOKEN million miles to URLTOKEN million miles - over three years , according to the latest annual reports , as part of what the agency described as a ` ` one - HMG approach to global health ' ' . The accounts explain how the department has been ` ` working closely ' ' with both Dfid and the Department for Health on ` ` agreed priorities , including the global health security agenda ; and [ to ] respond to emerging threats ' ' . With one of those emerging threats turning out to be coronavirus , Dr Ashton , who retired from the NHS in 2013 as PHE was launched , said the agency should have been quicker to respond . PHE ' s time would have been better spent , he said , ensuring testing facilities were up to scratch throughout the country . ` ` It ' s been inadequate and they have failed to catch up with themselves even when it was shown to be inadequate , ' ' he told The Telegraph . ` ` We ' ve known that influenza has had the potential to do this , especially a mutant virus of the kind we ' ve seen . We ' ve known this is something that is possible to happen and they should have been on top of all the way through .

1,COVID's Impact,COVID's Global Impact,testimony,"` ` Managerialist ' ' Whitehall culture is to blame for the Government ' s failures over coronavirus , according to a new report . The study by the Civitas think tank , published on Thursday , claims ` ` The Blob ' ' led Downing Street ` ` down the wrong path ' ' over its handling of the global pandemic .

1,COVID's Impact,COVID's Impact on Daily Life,testimony,"Santaco spokesperson Thabisho Molelekwa explains to Refilwe Moloto why they have chosen to openly defy the Transport Minister and State of Disaster regulations by declaring all their vehicles will carry full capacity as well as resume cross - provincial border trips as of Monday 29 June . ` ` We have tried to engage with the Minister of Transport which has failed . The minister does not seem to appreciate the gravity of the situation , ' ' says Molelekwa . It is for this reason , he says , that the leadership of Santaco took a decision to allow 100 % load capacity in taxis and allow long - distance operations to resume . He says in a meeting with the transport minister two weeks ago they raised how they could introduce these two issues with safety measures . ` ` We said we are more than happy to accept conditions set by the Command Council . ' ' He says Santaco made it clear it is willing to comply with government ' s differentiated approach in terms of provinces with different rates of infection . ` ` But at least get that moving . ' ' However , since that meeting two weeks ago , Molelekwa says the transport minister has postponed their meeting multiple times due to the Command Council meeting being postponed . Most recently Santaco ' s meeting was moved from Friday to Saturday to Sunday , and finally to Monday , adds Molelekwa . ` ` It seems clear that the minister is not willing to meet with the industry . If it was due to the Command Council then he could have said that . The minister postpones without URLTOKEN says postpone , postpone , postpone and he does not give reasons . ' ' He responds to claims that taxis have been carrying a full load right from the start of lockdown and that many say the sanitation measures have not been in place . ` ` How much percentage of that is happening ? And I can tell you that it is not even 15 % . ' ' He says they have had some complaints of this from commuters , particularly in Gauteng . ` ` If this is the case , we regret this . We should have acted in the appropriate way . ' ' He says lockdown has impacted the revenue of the industry because at the start it was operating with about 15 % of its total fleet . ` ` At the start , you had at least 200 , 000 taxis that were still at the stands . When the regulations were then relaxed you had about 50 % of the industry that was operating - and now you have 100 % . ' ' But , he says , the problem is taxis are doing far fewer trips in total , and that is the crisis the industry is facing in terms of revenue . He acknowledges there is no way government can help recover that money for the taxi industry . ` ` But just assist us to go through the six months , because if you do n ' t do that 45 % of taxi operators will lose their vehicles to repossession .

0,COVID's Impact,COVID's Impact on Daily Life,testimony,"Public Health England ' s approach to coronavirus has been ` ` totally negligent ' ' , according to a leading specialist , who also suggests the agency wasted resources by helping overseas . Dr John Ashton , the former director of public health in the North West , says he was concerned by an increasing workload which should have been left to the Department for International Development ( Dfid ) . Long - haul air miles carried out by staff almost doubled - from URLTOKEN million miles to URLTOKEN million miles - over three years , according to the latest annual reports , as part of what the agency described as a ` ` one - HMG approach to global health ' ' . The accounts explain how the department has been ` ` working closely ' ' with both Dfid and the Department for Health on ` ` agreed priorities , including the global health security agenda ; and [ to ] respond to emerging threats ' ' . With one of those emerging threats turning out to be coronavirus , Dr Ashton , who retired from the NHS in 2013 as PHE was launched , said the agency should have been quicker to respond . PHE ' s time would have been better spent , he said , ensuring testing facilities were up to scratch throughout the country . ` ` It ' s been inadequate and they have failed to catch up with themselves even when it was shown to be inadequate , ' ' he told The Telegraph . ` ` We ' ve known that influenza has had the potential to do this , especially a mutant virus of the kind we ' ve seen . We ' ve known this is something that is possible to happen and they should have been on top of all the way through . ' ' The Telegraph disclosed four weeks ago how ministers were informed three years ago that Britain would be quickly overwhelmed by a pandemic amid a shortage of critical care beds , morgue capacity and personal protective equipment ( PPE ) .",B-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O B-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O B-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-testimony I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-testimony I-testimony I-statistics I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O B-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O B-testimony I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O B-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O B-assumption I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-assumption I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony B-assumption I-assumption I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-assumption O I-testimony I-testimony B-anecdote I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/25/public-health-englands-plan-coronavirus-totally-negligent-says

0,COVID's Impact,COVID's Impact on Daily Life,testimony,"Santaco spokesperson Thabisho Molelekwa explains to Refilwe Moloto why they have chosen to openly defy the Transport Minister and State of Disaster regulations by declaring all their vehicles will carry full capacity as well as resume cross - provincial border trips as of Monday 29 June . ` ` We have tried to engage with the Minister of Transport which has failed . The minister does not seem to appreciate the gravity of the situation , ' ' says Molelekwa . It is for this reason , he says , that the leadership of Santaco took a decision to allow 100 % load capacity in taxis and allow long - distance operations to resume . He says in a meeting with the transport minister two weeks ago they raised how they could introduce these two issues with safety measures . ` ` We said we are more than happy to accept conditions set by the Command Council . ' ' He says Santaco made it clear it is willing to comply with government ' s differentiated approach in terms of provinces with different rates of infection . ` ` But at least get that moving . ' ' However , since that meeting two weeks ago , Molelekwa says the transport minister has postponed their meeting multiple times due to the Command Council meeting being postponed . Most recently Santaco ' s meeting was moved from Friday to Saturday to Sunday , and finally to Monday , adds Molelekwa . ` ` It seems clear that the minister is not willing to meet with the industry . If it was due to the Command Council then he could have said that . The minister postpones without URLTOKEN says postpone , postpone , postpone and he does not give reasons . ' ' He responds to claims that taxis have been carrying a full load right from the start of lockdown and that many say the sanitation measures have not been in place . ` ` How much percentage of that is happening ? And I can tell you that it is not even 15 % . ' ' He says they have had some complaints of this from commuters , particularly in Gauteng . ` ` If this is the case , we regret this . We should have acted in the appropriate way . ' ' He says lockdown has impacted the revenue of the industry because at the start it was operating with about 15 % of its total fleet . ` ` At the start , you had at least 200 , 000 taxis that were still at the stands . When the regulations were then relaxed you had about 50 % of the industry that was operating - and now you have 100 % . ' ' But , he says , the problem is taxis are doing far fewer trips in total , and that is the crisis the industry is facing in terms of revenue . He acknowledges there is no way government can help recover that money for the taxi industry . ` ` But just assist us to go through the six months , because if you do n ' t do that 45 % of taxi operators will lose their vehicles to repossession .

1,COVID's Impact,Public Security and Order,common,"© Getty Images California to release another 8 , 000 inmates early due to coronavirus pandemic California officials announced Friday that an additional 8 , 000 inmates would be released early from state prisons to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus among both inmates and staff . ` ` We ' re glad the Governor is taking action to release more people . This is absolutely critical for the health and safety of every Californian . Too many people are incarcerated for too long in facilities that spread poor health . Supporting the health and safety of all Californians means releasing people unnecessarily incarcerated and transforming our justice system , ' ' Californians for Safety and Justice Executive Director Jay Jordan said in a statement . The state Department of Corrections had already reduced the inmate population by 10 , 000 to help prevent the spread of coronavirus . To be eligible for release , inmates must have a year or less time to serve in their sentences , and must not be serving for domestic violence or a violent crime . They also must have no current or prior sentences that require a sex offender registration , and must not be considered at high risk for violence . Those over 30 years of age who are eligible will immediately be considered , while those ages 29 and under will have their release considered on a case - by - case basis . Inmates who are ` ` high risk ' ' such as those over 65 years old with chronic health conditions may also be considered for release . Smart Justice California Director Anne Irwin praised the decision in a press release , saying it ' s ` ` the right decision to help protect the lives of people living and working inside prisons and surrounding communities . ' ' The decision comes as California joins states seeing record cases in COVID - 19 after restrictions were lifted . California set a new record for the daily number of deaths from the virus on Thursday , with 149 new deaths and just more than 7 , 000 new cases of the virus . The state ' s total number of cases since the pandemic began is now more than 300 , 000 .",B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O O I-assumption B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-testimony I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O O O I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-anecdote I-common-ground I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-common-ground I-anecdote I-common-ground I-anecdote I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground O B-assumption I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground O B-assumption I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O I-testimony I-testimony B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-anecdote O B-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O B-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/california-to-release-another-8000-inmates-early-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic/ar-BB16AUOw

0,COVID's Impact,Public Security and Order,common,"© Getty Images California to release another 8 , 000 inmates early due to coronavirus pandemic California officials announced Friday that an additional 8 , 000 inmates would be released early from state prisons to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus among both inmates and staff . ` ` We ' re glad the Governor is taking action to release more people . This is absolutely critical for the health and safety of every Californian . Too many people are incarcerated for too long in facilities that spread poor health . Supporting the health and safety of all Californians means releasing people unnecessarily incarcerated and transforming our justice system , ' ' Californians for Safety and Justice Executive Director Jay Jordan said in a statement . The state Department of Corrections had already reduced the inmate population by 10 , 000 to help prevent the spread of coronavirus . To be eligible for release , inmates must have a year or less time to serve in their sentences , and must not be serving for domestic violence or a violent crime . They also must have no current or prior sentences that require a sex offender registration , and must not be considered at high risk for violence . Those over 30 years of age who are eligible will immediately be considered , while those ages 29 and under will have their release considered on a case - by - case basis . Inmates who are ` ` high risk ' ' such as those over 65 years old with chronic health conditions may also be considered for release . Smart Justice California Director Anne Irwin praised the decision in a press release , saying it ' s ` ` the right decision to help protect the lives of people living and working inside prisons and surrounding communities . ' ' The decision comes as California joins states seeing record cases in COVID - 19 after restrictions were lifted . California set a new record for the daily number of deaths from the virus on Thursday , with 149 new deaths and just more than 7 , 000 new cases of the virus . The state ' s total number of cases since the pandemic began is now more than 300 , 000 .",B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O O I-assumption B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-testimony I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O O O I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-anecdote I-common-ground I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-common-ground I-anecdote I-common-ground I-anecdote I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground O B-assumption I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground O B-assumption I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground I-common-ground O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O I-testimony I-testimony B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-anecdote O B-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O B-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/california-to-release-another-8000-inmates-early-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic/ar-BB16AUOw

Below is a screenshot comparison between the video in the misleading post ( L ) and the Imgur video ( R ) : Screenshot comparison between the video in the misleading post ( L ) and the Imgur video ( R ) The same video was also uploaded here on URLTOKEN , a Russian social media site , on December 19 , 2018 . The clip was shared by an account created in the name of Aerograd Kolomna , which corresponds with a parachuting centre based in the Russian city of Kolomna . According to this press release published by the parachuting company on July 16 , 2018 , a synchronised skydive was staged in a bid to set a world record in paradiving . Several other videos published on Aerograd Kolomna ' s Facebook page show similar paradiving activities , including this one . This report by Indian fact check site BOOM also debunked the claim in the misleading posts .",B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O O O O O O O O O O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote B-assumption B-assumption I-assumption I-testimony I-assumption I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-assumption I-assumption I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O,https://factcheck.afp.com/video-has-circulated-online-least-2018-posts-about-skydive-russia
1,COVID's Impact,COVID's Impact on Daily Life,anecdote,"I was woken by the silence . That is when I should have known the world was about to change . Usually , the planes start flying out of London City airport at 6am , but I am so used to them I don ’ t hear them . I mean , I was so used to them I didn ’ t hear them . That morning , 10 March , was before anything had really happened . The government had told us to wash our hands , and some people had stopped shaking each others ’ . Offices , including The Independent , were getting ready for staff to work from home , although we weren ’ t sure that would be necessary . And people were travelling less , hence the lack of planes . Even so , I didn ’ t think any of it applied to me . It being Tuesday , I went to the House of Commons as normal . I travelled by Tube , and thought nothing of it . I did a day ’ s work and came home . It was the last time I was there . The next day was Budget day . I expected to watch from the press gallery as Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn went through the motions of prime minister ’ s questions – likely to be an even lower - key encounter than usual just before the main event . Then I would be writing about Rishi Sunak ’ s big speech .

1,COVID's Impact,COVID Stories,anecdote,"My husband , Russell , and I were married for 62 years . We met on the pier in Clacton - on - Sea , where we did ballroom dancing to a live band , and went on to have two children and manage pubs together . At 83 , I still affectionately call him ‘ Hubby ’ . Russell and I both caught the coronavirus . He had already been in hospital for about three weeks with a list of ailments , including early - stage Parkinson ’ s and suspected bronchitis , when he contracted it . “ Cheerio love , I ’ ll see you tomorrow , ” I said to him at the end of a visit , as I always did . The next day , he was swept into a Covid - 19 ward and I was barred from seeing him . He was 87 and had diabetes . Soon after , my blood pressure dropped and I was taken in an ambulance to hospital , where I also tested positive . Russell died six weeks after he was hospitalised . I was on the same ward but didn ’ t get a chance to say goodbye . A nurse sent me a nice note saying she had been looking after Russell and that he wasn ’ t alone when he died . He didn ’ t have his family around him – just the voice notes they sent for him to listen to . I came home to an empty flat . At times , I think I hear him calling me , like he used to , even though I know he ’ s not here . I haven ’ t been able to cry since his death , it ’ s as if something is blocking the tears .",B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-assumption I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/husband-hospitalised-covid-19-one-came-home

Demonstrations began after footage circulated on social media showing a young man , identified as Giovanni Lopez , being detained by police on 4 May . Bystanders can be heard saying the police were arresting him for not using a face mask . Lopez , a construction worker , died in custody , a police statement said . His relatives later found his body at a hospital in the city , with a bullet wound on his foot . An autopsy found that he had died from a head injury . Gael García Bernal , a Mexican actor , was among those who expressed outrage at the police ’ s actions on social media . Enrique Alfaro , the governor of the state of Jalisco , denied that the man shown in the video had been detained for not using a face mask , but did not offer further comments on the incident .

Demonstrators attack a police vehicle during a protest in Guadalajara ( AFP via Getty Images ) Mexico ’ s deputy minister for human rights has asked for case files from authorities in Jalisco as well as Baja California , where a similar incident is thought to have taken place in February . Jalisco enforced strict measures to stem the spread of coronavirus , making the wearing of face masks mandatory . The protests against police brutality in Mexico came after more than a week of worldwide demonstrations against the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis , US .",B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O O O O O O O O O B-anecdote I-testimony I-testimony I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-testimony I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O O I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-mexico-police-death-face-mask-arrest-protest-a9550796.html
0,COVID's Impact,COVID Stories,anecdote,"This video has circulated online since at least 2018 in posts about a skydive in Russia Copyright AFP 2017 - 2020 . All rights reserved . A video has been shared thousands of times in multiple posts on Facebook alongside a claim that it shows bodies of Mexican COVID - 19 victims being dumped in the sea from a helicopter . The claim is false ; the video has circulated since 2018 about a synchronised skydive in Russia . The video was published here on Facebook on June 21 , 2020 . It was shared more than 4 , 700 times before it was deleted . The 18 - second clip shows a group of people jumping out of a helicopter . The Tamil - language caption translates to English as : “ Mexico is throwing those who died of Covid - 19 in mid sea . ” The video was also shared here and here on Facebook alongside a similar claim . A reverse image search on Google using keyframes extracted with InVID - WeVerify , a digital verification tool , found the same video published here on Imgur , on July 25 , 2018 . The post predates the COVID - 19 pandemic by at least one year . The video ' s title reads : “ Skydiving off the largest helicopter in use today , the Mi - 26 ’ ” . Mi - 26 is a Russia - manufactured heavy cargo helicopter used in both combat and civilian operations . Below is a screenshot comparison between the video in the misleading post ( L ) and the Imgur video ( R ) : Screenshot comparison between the video in the misleading post ( L ) and the Imgur video ( R ) The same video was also uploaded here on URLTOKEN , a Russian social media site , on December 19 , 2018 . The clip was shared by an account created in the name of Aerograd Kolomna , which corresponds with a parachuting centre based in the Russian city of Kolomna . According to this press release published by the parachuting company on July 16 , 2018 , a synchronised skydive was staged in a bid to set a world record in paradiving . Several other videos published on Aerograd Kolomna ' s Facebook page show similar paradiving activities , including this one .

0,COVID's Impact,COVID's Impact on Daily Life,anecdote,"I was woken by the silence . That is when I should have known the world was about to change . Usually , the planes start flying out of London City airport at 6am , but I am so used to them I don ’ t hear them . I mean , I was so used to them I didn ’ t hear them . That morning , 10 March , was before anything had really happened . The government had told us to wash our hands , and some people had stopped shaking each others ’ . Offices , including The Independent , were getting ready for staff to work from home , although we weren ’ t sure that would be necessary . And people were travelling less , hence the lack of planes . Even so , I didn ’ t think any of it applied to me . It being Tuesday , I went to the House of Commons as normal . I travelled by Tube , and thought nothing of it . I did a day ’ s work and came home . It was the last time I was there . The next day was Budget day . I expected to watch from the press gallery as Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn went through the motions of prime minister ’ s questions – likely to be an even lower - key encounter than usual just before the main event . Then I would be writing about Rishi Sunak ’ s big speech .

0,COVID's Impact,COVID Stories,anecdote,"My husband , Russell , and I were married for 62 years . We met on the pier in Clacton - on - Sea , where we did ballroom dancing to a live band , and went on to have two children and manage pubs together . At 83 , I still affectionately call him ‘ Hubby ’ . Russell and I both caught the coronavirus . He had already been in hospital for about three weeks with a list of ailments , including early - stage Parkinson ’ s and suspected bronchitis , when he contracted it . “ Cheerio love , I ’ ll see you tomorrow , ” I said to him at the end of a visit , as I always did . The next day , he was swept into a Covid - 19 ward and I was barred from seeing him . He was 87 and had diabetes . Soon after , my blood pressure dropped and I was taken in an ambulance to hospital , where I also tested positive . Russell died six weeks after he was hospitalised . I was on the same ward but didn ’ t get a chance to say goodbye . A nurse sent me a nice note saying she had been looking after Russell and that he wasn ’ t alone when he died . He didn ’ t have his family around him – just the voice notes they sent for him to listen to . I came home to an empty flat . At times , I think I hear him calling me , like he used to , even though I know he ’ s not here .

Throughout his stay in the hospital , he underwent a leg amputation , was given a temporary pacemaker and was put into a medically induced coma . He had been in the intensive care unit for more than 90 days and suffered from additional complications , like lung infections and septic shock . Kloots , had been giving updates on Cordero ’ s status on her Instagram stories throughout his hospital stay .

Cordero first hit the Broadway stage for “ Rock of Ages ” in 2012 as Dennis and Record Company Man . In 2014 , he earned a Tony nomination and a Drama Desk nomination for his role of Cheech in the musical adaptation of Woody Allen ’ s “ Bullets Over Broadway . ” He also appeared as Earl in “ Waitress , ” leaving to play Sonny in “ A Bronx Tale The Musical , ” for which he was nominated for a Drama Desk award .

After leaving Canada for New York , he originated the role of Toxie off - Broadway in “ The Toxic Avenger . ” Cordero is survived by his wife , who was a former Radio City Rockette and dancer , and their son , Elvis .

0,COVID's Impact,Public Security and Order,anecdote,"Protests have erupted in Mexico against police brutality in the second - largest city , Guadalajara , calling for authorities to be held accountable for the death in custody of a local man allegedly arrested for not wearing a face mask . During Thursday ' s unrest in the state capital of Jalisco , police cars were set on fire and buildings including the government palace vandalised . Police responded with force , beating demonstrators with batons and firing tear gas . Demonstrations began after footage circulated on social media showing a young man , identified as Giovanni Lopez , being detained by police on 4 May . Bystanders can be heard saying the police were arresting him for not using a face mask . Lopez , a construction worker , died in custody , a police statement said . His relatives later found his body at a hospital in the city , with a bullet wound on his foot . An autopsy found that he had died from a head injury . Gael García Bernal , a Mexican actor , was among those who expressed outrage at the police ’ s actions on social media . Enrique Alfaro , the governor of the state of Jalisco , denied that the man shown in the video had been detained for not using a face mask , but did not offer further comments on the incident . Read our full mailing list consent terms here He said that during the protests on Thursday six police officers had been injured , including one who was set on fire , and 22 men and 2 women were arrested . Demonstrators attack a police vehicle during a protest in Guadalajara ( AFP via Getty Images ) Mexico ’ s deputy minister for human rights has asked for case files from authorities in Jalisco as well as Baja California , where a similar incident is thought to have taken place in February . Jalisco enforced strict measures to stem the spread of coronavirus , making the wearing of face masks mandatory . The protests against police brutality in Mexico came after more than a week of worldwide demonstrations against the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis , US .",B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O O O O O O O O O B-anecdote I-testimony I-testimony I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-testimony I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O O I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-mexico-police-death-face-mask-arrest-protest-a9550796.html
1,Travel Restrictions and Lockdown,Travel,assumption,"While the Premier League giddily hopes for final - day excitement to match that of the Championship , there is still a prospect that some at the very top of the game don ’ t want to consider . Some clubs currently have to put it out of their minds . As it stands , the decisive moment in the relegation battle - and maybe even the Champions League chase - came in the very first half of Project Restart , and due to a failure of technology that far superseded anything to do with VAR . That was when Hawkeye failed to work for Oerhan Haaskjold Nyland ` ` save ' ' of Oliver Norwood ’ s free - kick , having carried it over his line . The subsequent 0 - 0 draw is what currently has Aston Villa just ahead of Watford outside the relegation zone , and may well have stunted Sheffield United ’ s Champions League surge . Villa themselves could point to the possibility that VAR had already failed them just before that , since they might have had a penalty for a challenge on Anwar El - Ghazi . That first day back might prove so monumental , in more ways than one , as we ready ourselves for the last day . These are the kinds of complications and what - ifs that all of Manchester United , Chelsea , Leicester City , Villa , Watford and Bournemouth have to forget about to maintain focus for this last late push . Sheffield United react as Orjan Nyland carries the ball over the line ( Getty ) ( AFP ) This is nevertheless what the 2019 - 20 season will be remembered for , way beyond anything else . Never before has a single campaign been so influenced by what ’ s happened off the pitch . That very sentence feels a massive understatement to even say it . Complaints about VAR pale next to what came in March . Read our full mailing list consent terms here That we ’ re here at all is to the credit of the Premier League , and new chief executive Richard Masters . He has passed a challenge that would scarcely have been imaginable when he got the job . There were times in March , April and even May when completing the season seemed impossible . The game ’ s very safety amid Covid - 19 offered enough complications . In that regard , the Premier League ’ s measured approach in the face of all kinds of hysterical criticism deserves praise . Football has passed off with utmost safety . There were many that considered it a non - starter . But that was just one part of the problem . The game ’ s very integrity offered much greater complications . They still hang over the final day , since corralling back the clubs in danger of relegation was the Premier League ’ s greatest challenge . Many - particularly Watford and Villa - had fair concerns over the nature of relegation in the circumstances . That battle is one reason we ’ re all still here , to settle something that means so much , especially in financial terms . It is also fitting that a season that so often came down to the millimetres of VAR calls , and has endured the longest gap the game has ever seen , goes the distance and will likely come down to even tighter margins . Maybe goal difference . That the final day won ’ t involve the real main event of a title race , however , appropriately reflects how there ’ s something missing ; that this isn ’ t full football yet . The absence of supporters will perhaps be sharpest on Sunday . The final day is one of the times they concretely influence proceedings more than any other , because of how the reactions let players know what is happening elsewhere - especially in the relegation battle . The ease with which Liverpool won the title has had a direct influence on that relegation battle , too . It reflects this profound financial disparity that is eroding the game ’ s unpredictability , and has itself made Project Restart such a massive necessity . Most clubs needed the money . The gap is too great . Eddie Howe watches on as Bournemouth lose at Manchester City ( Getty ) And when the wealthiest clubs get it right , it ’ s never been easier for them to win games . That is partly why , for what will likely be the 17th season out of the last 18 , the surviving clubs won ’ t need anywhere near 40 points to stay up . It is harder for anyone else to gather points in such a league . The threshold has significantly fallen . The 40 - point figure is a myth . The average points the 18th team have ended up with over the last half decade has been a mere URLTOKEN It may well remain 34 on Sunday , especially as it ’ s currently so difficult to see a deflated Watford rousing themselves for Arsenal . It has certainly felt as if this relegation battle isn ’ t so much about who secures survival as who stays standing up while those around them collapse . There ’ s no other way to describe Watford ’ s situation , or Bournemouth ’ s . One single win was really enough to do it for West Ham and Brighton and Hove Albion . Villa ’ s rise so far isn ’ t a great escape but a good effort . That may change on Sunday . The situation may finally bring the response required from Watford . Arsenal aren ’ t exactly assured against lower opposition . It has the potential for a chaotic back and forth , from Arsenal - Watford to West Ham - Villa , and maybe even Everton - Bournemouth . They know what they have to try and do . So do all of United , Leicester and Chelsea . We may not have a greater indication of this financial disparity than that Champions League chase , that other pursuit of the promised land . After a season that had stood out for the strides of Sheffield United , Wolves and Leicester City , where so many of the biggest clubs seemed so fragile , the top four could yet be filled by … the wealthiest four of the big six . It looks the likeliest outcome right now . Chelsea need only a point at home to Wolves , who are hoping to secure European football ahead of Tottenham Hotspur . The Covid crisis means that Europa League prize money is actually more important than ever , especially if you ’ ve just started paying back a billion - pound stadium . Chelsea ’ s own unreliability may yet make that match as entertainingly chaotic as anything that happens at the bottom . Leicester meanwhile need to win at the King Power to make sure . That means they also need to transform their own form of the last few weeks . Leicester can finish inside the top four with victory ( POOL / AFP via Getty ) ( Getty ) Given that this was a side who had in December seemed potential title challengers , it would be a major disappointment to finish outside the top four . And yet , when you stand back , fifth place would still represent significant over - performance for a club of such resources . It would look much better if the season was reversed . That ’ s how conditioned the game is by money . That ’ s how off - pitch developments really influence it . In that sense , there ’ s perhaps only one way for this oddest of seasons to end : a VAR decision in stoppage time that goes way over - time .",O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption

1,Travel Restrictions and Lockdown,Lockdown,assumption,"We ’ re going to be hearing a lot about local lockdowns in the weeks and months to come . Leicester ’ s will not be the last imposed with the aim of keeping a cluster of Covid - 19 contained . If they prove effective , such targeted actions are obviously better than the nationwide snooze we ’ ve been living through since the end of March . With this in mind , something unusual has happened . Local councils have been handed new powers . They will be able to close some premises , shut down outdoor spaces , cancel events if the virus starts to rage in their localities . Sharing power with anyone is a highly unusual occurrence under Boris Johnson and his puppet master Dominic Cummings . Their fondness for the idea of ruling by decree is well known . Their high handed treatment of the devolved administrations may yet blow up the United Kingdom . The sinister plans in the Tory manifesto to torch even the limited checks and balances that exist to restrain them under Britain ’ s creaking constitution are there for all to see in black and white . But if BoZo the clown and his malevolent Svengali have seen a light on the road to Damascus , that ’ s a welcome development , right ? After all , councils know their localities a lot better than Whitehall does . Britain would surely work better if the UK government recognised that , instead of constantly trying to rule by centralised diktat – because Leeds has very different challenges , and requirements , to Ludlow . One size does not fit all . So in theory , yes this is a sensible idea . In practice ? It ’ s hard not to look at it without a heavy dose of cynicism given the way the shabby lot we have in government have been carrying on to date . Let me explain . Johnson ’ s government is not alone in trying to deflect blame and weasel its way out of taking responsibility for anything . It has just taken the game to new levels of absurdity . Read our full mailing list consent terms here Nothing is the government ’ s fault . Everything is down to someone else ’ s foul up , whether that ’ s a quango ( created to take tough decisions ministers want to avoid taking themselves ) , the EU ( which they ’ re still going to find a way to blame for anything they can ) , or local councils . Giving the latter new powers also gives them new responsibilities while opening up the opportunity for the government to land the liability for anything that goes wrong on the steps of the town hall . Cluster in Tolford ? Yes it ’ s terrible , I know . But we gave the council the powers to shut stuff down and they didn ’ t do it . I suggest you contact them if you ’ ve got any questions . Business gone kaput in locked down Lamworth ? I think you should ask them about why they jumped the gun and shut the place down before they needed to . We know . It ’ s a mess . But local councils , eh , what can you do ? Next time we ’ ll keep things in Whitehall ! The government is still retaining the power to jump in and impose lockdowns off its own bat if it feels the need , if Tadford ’ s refusal to act is because council leader Harry Fellows was around Oxford when Johnson and the other Bullingdon boys were raising hell , knows the way he operates – and understands what a political trap looks like . Otherwise , here lies a marvellous opportunity for Johnson and co to shirk responsibility for the sort of failings that have seen a 20 - point poll lead go up in smoke because 45 , 000 Britons have died from Covid - 19 and maybe half of them could have been saved .",B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption

1,Travel Restrictions and Lockdown,Travel,assumption,"Let ’ s see if we ’ ve got this straight : Texas ’ big high schools won ’ t start football practice until after Labor Day because of the growing pandemic , and championships will run through Christmas into the new and , hopefully , far different year . Meanwhile , smaller schools can proceed as if nothing ’ s happened at all . Except , of course , for smaller schools in areas where municipalities have already imposed their own restrictions . Those schools , the UIL ruled Monday , will simply end up playing “ as many contests as possible . ” Yeah , this sounds like a plan . Of course , the UIL was in an untenable position in the first place . Trying to come up with a one - size - fits - all plan , one that would allow football and volleyball to return to normal , or something remotely resembling normal , was next to impossible . Texas is a big place , as you might have heard . Not all of it looks like The Last Picture Show . Marfa ’ s entire population ( 1 , 714 ) could social distance and then some at Allen Eagle Stadium ( 18 , 000 capacity ) . Maybe they can still play football on schedule as always in some of the state ’ s far - flung places , so distant from the state ’ s hot spots . Or maybe playing football in these remote reaches will make Texas even hotter than it already is . Because here ’ s the thing about the spread of COVID - 19 : Even if statistics show that , in the vast majority of cases , young people almost invariably recover with little ill effect , it doesn ’ t change the fact that young people live with older people . In a lot of cases , much older people . And the recovery rates of these kids ’ hosts isn ’ t nearly as good . The good news is that by pushing back the start of practices at the larger schools from Aug . 3 to Sept . 7 , it builds in a cushion that would give us time to see where the pandemic is going . Maybe leave us time to correct course if the infection curve hasn ’ t at least flattened . Let ’ s hope that ’ s in the plan , anyway , because , given the risk of transmission in football , it feels a little foolish to think we should be playing at all this fall .

1,Travel Restrictions and Lockdown,Lockdown,assumption,"Proud reprobates everywhere are already devising their own “ pub name ” ( made up of the names of their first pet and the first road on which they lived and I furnish you with this information as Mr Rusty Rathmore ) . While at the pub , drinkers must endeavour to stay two metres apart , but will not be permitted to talk in a loud voice , a combination of rules that stirs in me a vague recollection of the 1970s sitcom “ I Didn ’ t Know You Cared ” , replete with the punchline : “ I heard that , pardon ? ” At the other end of the lifestyle spectrum , keep fit fanatics are to be deprived of their gyms for a while longer on account of Whitehall sub - committees being unable to work out a practical way of proscribing sweating or heavy breathing . One particularly ludicrous element of the guidance concerns the resumption of weddings : up to 30 guests can be invited to the church ( though there must be no singing ) but only one other household may join the happy couple at the reception . For imminent grooms contemplating an early social distancing victory over the new mother - in - law , let me save you time : Forget it . Her side wins . Business Secretary Alok Sharma hit a more sensible note when he urged people to continue using “ common sense ” when interpreting official guidelines . If only ministers had done the same when setting them . This is , after all , a country where thousands of people have demonstrated in city centres in open defiance of the last set of lockdown rules and been knelt before by the police for doing so . That was a shattering blow to the notion of a Command Polity . This is therefore not a country that can any longer be told in minute detail what it is permitted to do in respect of size of groups or the nature of interactions . While there is a grim inevitability about the eventual onset of some kind of “ second spike ” – particularly when colder weather arrives in the autumn – the risk of it being of a scale that would overwhelm the NHS is tiny . And that was , after all , the original justification for the lockdown . We needed to flatten the curve or squash the sombrero as the old , BC ( Before Covid ) Boris put it . We not only did that , but we also flattened the economy in the process .",B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption

1,Travel Restrictions and Lockdown,Travel,assumption,"© Provided by CNET Be safe while vacationing during the pandemic . Eric Mack / CNET The continuing surge of COVID - 19 around the world has thrown a wet blanket on summertime dreams of nature retreats , beach vacations and global getaways . The coronavirus certainly feels like a big obstacle to planning a vacation . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that travel increases your chances of getting or spreading coronavirus , so the safest itinerary to protect yourself and vulnerable people would be to stay at home . If you still plan to travel at some point this summer by air or road , however , learn how to minimize your contact with people outside your household and be aware of the risks . © Eric Mack / CNET Dalawella Beach , Sri Lanka Riskier vacation options vs . less risky Some locations and activities may put you at a higher risk for contracting the coronavirus . Camping in the backcountry with your family . Renting a vacation home through Airbnb or Vrbo for your family or inner circle . Visiting a busy beach or lake Flying to another country that is n ' t on lockdown and has no quarantine measures for travelers . Before you make plans to visit another state , it ' s important to know the local laws so you ' re aware of what ' s open . This can also help prepare you for what ' s expected of you , like wearing face masks inside all stores and restaurants . 2 . Be wary of travel to known coronavirus hotspots The coronavirus is highly contagious and can take weeks for symptoms to develop , if they do at all . That means there ' s a good chance that areas known to have high levels of confirmed COVID - 19 cases may also have a greater number of people going about their daily lives who could be unknowingly infected . Be aware of COVID hotspots , like parts of Florida , Texas , Georgia and California , where cases are on the rise . If you ' re visiting family in the state , it ' s safest to stay outside of crowded areas and skip the sightseeing . When possible , choose less - traveled destinations . © Provided by CNET Do n ' t forget to pack the face masks . Anna Munoz / CNET 3 . Consider getting a coronavirus test You may want to get tested for coronavirus before you go on your vacation - - you could be an asymptomatic carrier - - and when you get back . If someone is visiting you for their vacation , you can ask them to take a COVID - 19 test before they arrive . 4 . Be extra cautious when you fly Air travel is considered one of the riskier situations for spreading the coronavirus . Even if airports are relatively uncrowded , not every airline spaces passengers throughout the plane . You may not be able to social - distance , and longer flights potentially expose you to more recirculated air - - it ' s still unclear if the coronavirus is airborne , but the World Health Organization has recently admitted that it ' s possible . If you must fly , take all precautions , including wearing a face mask except while eating or drinking water , thoroughly washing your hands and keeping your distance from others as much as possible . Note that if you rent a car , you should call ahead of time to ask how the vehicles are disinfected between renters . © Provided by CNET If you feel at all sick , do n ' t travel . You could risk exposing others , and worsening your symptoms far from home . Sarah Tew / CNET 5 . Stay away from crowded areas While beaches may be your usual go - to when planning a trip , they may not be the safest option if other people have flocked to the area . They ' re often crowded , making it improbable not to pass crowds in the parking lots or while finding a spot on the sand . While the water itself is n ' t thought to spread the coronavirus , shouting to others in your group and singing along with music are known to spray respiratory droplets , which is how the coronavirus spreads . The same goes for crowded farmers markets and high - traffic downtown shopping areas , especially if they ' re indoors . You should also avoid bars where people are typically crowded together waiting for drinks or on the dance floor , if those businesses are open . Instead , look for areas that are out of the way and have fewer people , and get your drinks and food to go . Even if you wear a mask and social - distance , you ca n ' t control the actions of those around you who choose not to . 6 . Do n ' t travel with anyone who ' s sick in any way If you have a relative that you ' re planning to travel with and they become infected or develop coronavirus symptoms - - some of which resemble a cold or the flu - - leave them at home . Also , if you ' ve been in contact with that person since they ' ve become infected , you need to get a coronavirus test before you leave for your destination to ensure you ' re not sick and potentially spreading the virus to high - risk groups . 7 . Bring a face mask or two At this point , most businesses you go to will require you to wear a face mask before entering . This means local shops , grocery stores and even restaurants while you ' re waiting for your food . Pack several face masks for your kids and yourself so that you have plenty for the duration of your trip . If you ' re going somewhere that ' s hot , look for a cotton - blend mask , which can be cooler and more comfortable . Face masks can help prevent the spread of coronavirus if worn correctly . Make sure the one you ' re wearing is covering your nose and chin and does n ' t create gaps . Masks that use thicker material and designs with more layers might trap larger particles you accidentally eject through talking , coughing or sneezing , but they may also be warmer to wear . < PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 25 NEXT SLIDE > Now that businesses have reopened throughout the US , you may see that most will require you to wear a mask or face covering before entering . Whether you ' re buying a mask or making a homemade face covering , you ' ll need to get one soon if you ' re planning on going anywhere . Here are the masks our CNET editors are wearing when we leave the house . ( These were lovingly made by CNET Senior Managing Editor Dan Ackerman ' s URLTOKEN if you ' re looking for more unique masks , you can find some here . © Provided by CNET 8 . Minimize contact with people not in your immediate group When vacationing , it ' s best to stick with only the people in your household . The more people you come into contact with , the higher your chances are of contracting the virus . If you know you ' ll be going somewhere that has a large number of people , like a major city , wear a mask whenever you leave your accommodations , even to ride an elevator or ride in a taxi cab . Wash your hands often and bring hand sanitizer to areas where a hand - washing station is n ' t provided . If you know you ' ll be frequenting restaurants while on your trip , call ahead to make sure they have outdoor seating . Eating outside is considered much less risky than eating inside because airflow disperses the coronavirus rather than allowing it to collect in a single spot . Remember that even though you ' re outside , you should still wear a mask until your food arrives , especially since you ' ll be in constant contact with your server , who is in turn in constant contact with other members of the public . For more information on COVID - 19 , read up on why we ' re still in the first wave and what happens next . Also , remember that people who are asymptomatic can spread coronavirus . Here ' s how long it takes to get coronavirus test results back .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption

0,Travel Restrictions and Lockdown,Travel,assumption,"While the Premier League giddily hopes for final - day excitement to match that of the Championship , there is still a prospect that some at the very top of the game don ’ t want to consider . Some clubs currently have to put it out of their minds . As it stands , the decisive moment in the relegation battle - and maybe even the Champions League chase - came in the very first half of Project Restart , and due to a failure of technology that far superseded anything to do with VAR . That was when Hawkeye failed to work for Oerhan Haaskjold Nyland ` ` save ' ' of Oliver Norwood ’ s free - kick , having carried it over his line . The subsequent 0 - 0 draw is what currently has Aston Villa just ahead of Watford outside the relegation zone , and may well have stunted Sheffield United ’ s Champions League surge . Villa themselves could point to the possibility that VAR had already failed them just before that , since they might have had a penalty for a challenge on Anwar El - Ghazi . That first day back might prove so monumental , in more ways than one , as we ready ourselves for the last day . These are the kinds of complications and what - ifs that all of Manchester United , Chelsea , Leicester City , Villa , Watford and Bournemouth have to forget about to maintain focus for this last late push . Sheffield United react as Orjan Nyland carries the ball over the line ( Getty ) ( AFP ) This is nevertheless what the 2019 - 20 season will be remembered for , way beyond anything else . Never before has a single campaign been so influenced by what ’ s happened off the pitch . That very sentence feels a massive understatement to even say it . Complaints about VAR pale next to what came in March . Read our full mailing list consent terms here That we ’ re here at all is to the credit of the Premier League , and new chief executive Richard Masters . He has passed a challenge that would scarcely have been imaginable when he got the job . There were times in March , April and even May when completing the season seemed impossible . The game ’ s very safety amid Covid - 19 offered enough complications . In that regard , the Premier League ’ s measured approach in the face of all kinds of hysterical criticism deserves praise . Football has passed off with utmost safety . There were many that considered it a non - starter . But that was just one part of the problem . The game ’ s very integrity offered much greater complications . They still hang over the final day , since corralling back the clubs in danger of relegation was the Premier League ’ s greatest challenge . Many - particularly Watford and Villa - had fair concerns over the nature of relegation in the circumstances . That battle is one reason we ’ re all still here , to settle something that means so much , especially in financial terms . It is also fitting that a season that so often came down to the millimetres of VAR calls , and has endured the longest gap the game has ever seen , goes the distance and will likely come down to even tighter margins . Maybe goal difference . That the final day won ’ t involve the real main event of a title race , however , appropriately reflects how there ’ s something missing ; that this isn ’ t full football yet . The absence of supporters will perhaps be sharpest on Sunday . The final day is one of the times they concretely influence proceedings more than any other , because of how the reactions let players know what is happening elsewhere - especially in the relegation battle . The ease with which Liverpool won the title has had a direct influence on that relegation battle , too . It reflects this profound financial disparity that is eroding the game ’ s unpredictability , and has itself made Project Restart such a massive necessity . Most clubs needed the money . The gap is too great . Eddie Howe watches on as Bournemouth lose at Manchester City ( Getty ) And when the wealthiest clubs get it right , it ’ s never been easier for them to win games . That is partly why , for what will likely be the 17th season out of the last 18 , the surviving clubs won ’ t need anywhere near 40 points to stay up . It is harder for anyone else to gather points in such a league . The threshold has significantly fallen . The 40 - point figure is a myth . The average points the 18th team have ended up with over the last half decade has been a mere URLTOKEN It may well remain 34 on Sunday , especially as it ’ s currently so difficult to see a deflated Watford rousing themselves for Arsenal . It has certainly felt as if this relegation battle isn ’ t so much about who secures survival as who stays standing up while those around them collapse . There ’ s no other way to describe Watford ’ s situation , or Bournemouth ’ s . One single win was really enough to do it for West Ham and Brighton and Hove Albion . Villa ’ s rise so far isn ’ t a great escape but a good effort . That may change on Sunday . The situation may finally bring the response required from Watford . Arsenal aren ’ t exactly assured against lower opposition . It has the potential for a chaotic back and forth , from Arsenal - Watford to West Ham - Villa , and maybe even Everton - Bournemouth . They know what they have to try and do . So do all of United , Leicester and Chelsea . We may not have a greater indication of this financial disparity than that Champions League chase , that other pursuit of the promised land . After a season that had stood out for the strides of Sheffield United , Wolves and Leicester City , where so many of the biggest clubs seemed so fragile , the top four could yet be filled by … the wealthiest four of the big six . It looks the likeliest outcome right now . Chelsea need only a point at home to Wolves , who are hoping to secure European football ahead of Tottenham Hotspur . The Covid crisis means that Europa League prize money is actually more important than ever , especially if you ’ ve just started paying back a billion - pound stadium . Chelsea ’ s own unreliability may yet make that match as entertainingly chaotic as anything that happens at the bottom . Leicester meanwhile need to win at the King Power to make sure . That means they also need to transform their own form of the last few weeks . Leicester can finish inside the top four with victory ( POOL / AFP via Getty ) ( Getty ) Given that this was a side who had in December seemed potential title challengers , it would be a major disappointment to finish outside the top four . And yet , when you stand back , fifth place would still represent significant over - performance for a club of such resources . It would look much better if the season was reversed . That ’ s how conditioned the game is by money . That ’ s how off - pitch developments really influence it . In that sense , there ’ s perhaps only one way for this oddest of seasons to end : a VAR decision in stoppage time that goes way over - time .",O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption

0,Travel Restrictions and Lockdown,Lockdown,assumption,"We ’ re going to be hearing a lot about local lockdowns in the weeks and months to come . Leicester ’ s will not be the last imposed with the aim of keeping a cluster of Covid - 19 contained . If they prove effective , such targeted actions are obviously better than the nationwide snooze we ’ ve been living through since the end of March . With this in mind , something unusual has happened . Local councils have been handed new powers . They will be able to close some premises , shut down outdoor spaces , cancel events if the virus starts to rage in their localities . Sharing power with anyone is a highly unusual occurrence under Boris Johnson and his puppet master Dominic Cummings . Their fondness for the idea of ruling by decree is well known . Their high handed treatment of the devolved administrations may yet blow up the United Kingdom . The sinister plans in the Tory manifesto to torch even the limited checks and balances that exist to restrain them under Britain ’ s creaking constitution are there for all to see in black and white . But if BoZo the clown and his malevolent Svengali have seen a light on the road to Damascus , that ’ s a welcome development , right ? After all , councils know their localities a lot better than Whitehall does . Britain would surely work better if the UK government recognised that , instead of constantly trying to rule by centralised diktat – because Leeds has very different challenges , and requirements , to Ludlow . One size does not fit all . So in theory , yes this is a sensible idea . In practice ? It ’ s hard not to look at it without a heavy dose of cynicism given the way the shabby lot we have in government have been carrying on to date . Let me explain . Johnson ’ s government is not alone in trying to deflect blame and weasel its way out of taking responsibility for anything . It has just taken the game to new levels of absurdity . Read our full mailing list consent terms here Nothing is the government ’ s fault . Everything is down to someone else ’ s foul up , whether that ’ s a quango ( created to take tough decisions ministers want to avoid taking themselves ) , the EU ( which they ’ re still going to find a way to blame for anything they can ) , or local councils . Giving the latter new powers also gives them new responsibilities while opening up the opportunity for the government to land the liability for anything that goes wrong on the steps of the town hall . Cluster in Tolford ? Yes it ’ s terrible , I know . But we gave the council the powers to shut stuff down and they didn ’ t do it . I suggest you contact them if you ’ ve got any questions . Business gone kaput in locked down Lamworth ? I think you should ask them about why they jumped the gun and shut the place down before they needed to . We know . It ’ s a mess . But local councils , eh , what can you do ? Next time we ’ ll keep things in Whitehall ! The government is still retaining the power to jump in and impose lockdowns off its own bat if it feels the need , if Tadford ’ s refusal to act is because council leader Harry Fellows was around Oxford when Johnson and the other Bullingdon boys were raising hell , knows the way he operates – and understands what a political trap looks like . Otherwise , here lies a marvellous opportunity for Johnson and co to shirk responsibility for the sort of failings that have seen a 20 - point poll lead go up in smoke because 45 , 000 Britons have died from Covid - 19 and maybe half of them could have been saved .",B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption

0,Travel Restrictions and Lockdown,Travel,assumption,"Let ’ s see if we ’ ve got this straight : Texas ’ big high schools won ’ t start football practice until after Labor Day because of the growing pandemic , and championships will run through Christmas into the new and , hopefully , far different year . Meanwhile , smaller schools can proceed as if nothing ’ s happened at all . Except , of course , for smaller schools in areas where municipalities have already imposed their own restrictions . Those schools , the UIL ruled Monday , will simply end up playing “ as many contests as possible . ” Yeah , this sounds like a plan . Of course , the UIL was in an untenable position in the first place . Trying to come up with a one - size - fits - all plan , one that would allow football and volleyball to return to normal , or something remotely resembling normal , was next to impossible . Texas is a big place , as you might have heard . Not all of it looks like The Last Picture Show . Marfa ’ s entire population ( 1 , 714 ) could social distance and then some at Allen Eagle Stadium ( 18 , 000 capacity ) . Maybe they can still play football on schedule as always in some of the state ’ s far - flung places , so distant from the state ’ s hot spots . Or maybe playing football in these remote reaches will make Texas even hotter than it already is . Because here ’ s the thing about the spread of COVID - 19 : Even if statistics show that , in the vast majority of cases , young people almost invariably recover with little ill effect , it doesn ’ t change the fact that young people live with older people . In a lot of cases , much older people . And the recovery rates of these kids ’ hosts isn ’ t nearly as good . The good news is that by pushing back the start of practices at the larger schools from Aug . 3 to Sept . 7 , it builds in a cushion that would give us time to see where the pandemic is going . Maybe leave us time to correct course if the infection curve hasn ’ t at least flattened . Let ’ s hope that ’ s in the plan , anyway , because , given the risk of transmission in football , it feels a little foolish to think we should be playing at all this fall .

0,Travel Restrictions and Lockdown,Lockdown,assumption,"Proud reprobates everywhere are already devising their own “ pub name ” ( made up of the names of their first pet and the first road on which they lived and I furnish you with this information as Mr Rusty Rathmore ) . While at the pub , drinkers must endeavour to stay two metres apart , but will not be permitted to talk in a loud voice , a combination of rules that stirs in me a vague recollection of the 1970s sitcom “ I Didn ’ t Know You Cared ” , replete with the punchline : “ I heard that , pardon ? ” At the other end of the lifestyle spectrum , keep fit fanatics are to be deprived of their gyms for a while longer on account of Whitehall sub - committees being unable to work out a practical way of proscribing sweating or heavy breathing . One particularly ludicrous element of the guidance concerns the resumption of weddings : up to 30 guests can be invited to the church ( though there must be no singing ) but only one other household may join the happy couple at the reception . For imminent grooms contemplating an early social distancing victory over the new mother - in - law , let me save you time : Forget it . Her side wins . Business Secretary Alok Sharma hit a more sensible note when he urged people to continue using “ common sense ” when interpreting official guidelines . If only ministers had done the same when setting them . This is , after all , a country where thousands of people have demonstrated in city centres in open defiance of the last set of lockdown rules and been knelt before by the police for doing so . That was a shattering blow to the notion of a Command Polity . This is therefore not a country that can any longer be told in minute detail what it is permitted to do in respect of size of groups or the nature of interactions . While there is a grim inevitability about the eventual onset of some kind of “ second spike ” – particularly when colder weather arrives in the autumn – the risk of it being of a scale that would overwhelm the NHS is tiny . And that was , after all , the original justification for the lockdown . We needed to flatten the curve or squash the sombrero as the old , BC ( Before Covid ) Boris put it . We not only did that , but we also flattened the economy in the process .",B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption

0,Travel Restrictions and Lockdown,Travel,assumption,"© Provided by CNET Be safe while vacationing during the pandemic . Eric Mack / CNET The continuing surge of COVID - 19 around the world has thrown a wet blanket on summertime dreams of nature retreats , beach vacations and global getaways . The coronavirus certainly feels like a big obstacle to planning a vacation . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that travel increases your chances of getting or spreading coronavirus , so the safest itinerary to protect yourself and vulnerable people would be to stay at home . If you still plan to travel at some point this summer by air or road , however , learn how to minimize your contact with people outside your household and be aware of the risks . © Eric Mack / CNET Dalawella Beach , Sri Lanka Riskier vacation options vs . less risky Some locations and activities may put you at a higher risk for contracting the coronavirus . Camping in the backcountry with your family . Renting a vacation home through Airbnb or Vrbo for your family or inner circle . Visiting a busy beach or lake Flying to another country that is n ' t on lockdown and has no quarantine measures for travelers . Before you make plans to visit another state , it ' s important to know the local laws so you ' re aware of what ' s open . This can also help prepare you for what ' s expected of you , like wearing face masks inside all stores and restaurants . 2 . Be wary of travel to known coronavirus hotspots The coronavirus is highly contagious and can take weeks for symptoms to develop , if they do at all . That means there ' s a good chance that areas known to have high levels of confirmed COVID - 19 cases may also have a greater number of people going about their daily lives who could be unknowingly infected . Be aware of COVID hotspots , like parts of Florida , Texas , Georgia and California , where cases are on the rise . If you ' re visiting family in the state , it ' s safest to stay outside of crowded areas and skip the sightseeing . When possible , choose less - traveled destinations . © Provided by CNET Do n ' t forget to pack the face masks . Anna Munoz / CNET 3 . Consider getting a coronavirus test You may want to get tested for coronavirus before you go on your vacation - - you could be an asymptomatic carrier - - and when you get back . If someone is visiting you for their vacation , you can ask them to take a COVID - 19 test before they arrive . 4 . Be extra cautious when you fly Air travel is considered one of the riskier situations for spreading the coronavirus . Even if airports are relatively uncrowded , not every airline spaces passengers throughout the plane . You may not be able to social - distance , and longer flights potentially expose you to more recirculated air - - it ' s still unclear if the coronavirus is airborne , but the World Health Organization has recently admitted that it ' s possible . If you must fly , take all precautions , including wearing a face mask except while eating or drinking water , thoroughly washing your hands and keeping your distance from others as much as possible . Note that if you rent a car , you should call ahead of time to ask how the vehicles are disinfected between renters . © Provided by CNET If you feel at all sick , do n ' t travel . You could risk exposing others , and worsening your symptoms far from home . Sarah Tew / CNET 5 . Stay away from crowded areas While beaches may be your usual go - to when planning a trip , they may not be the safest option if other people have flocked to the area . They ' re often crowded , making it improbable not to pass crowds in the parking lots or while finding a spot on the sand . While the water itself is n ' t thought to spread the coronavirus , shouting to others in your group and singing along with music are known to spray respiratory droplets , which is how the coronavirus spreads . The same goes for crowded farmers markets and high - traffic downtown shopping areas , especially if they ' re indoors . You should also avoid bars where people are typically crowded together waiting for drinks or on the dance floor , if those businesses are open . Instead , look for areas that are out of the way and have fewer people , and get your drinks and food to go . Even if you wear a mask and social - distance , you ca n ' t control the actions of those around you who choose not to . 6 . Do n ' t travel with anyone who ' s sick in any way If you have a relative that you ' re planning to travel with and they become infected or develop coronavirus symptoms - - some of which resemble a cold or the flu - - leave them at home . Also , if you ' ve been in contact with that person since they ' ve become infected , you need to get a coronavirus test before you leave for your destination to ensure you ' re not sick and potentially spreading the virus to high - risk groups . 7 . Bring a face mask or two At this point , most businesses you go to will require you to wear a face mask before entering . This means local shops , grocery stores and even restaurants while you ' re waiting for your food . Pack several face masks for your kids and yourself so that you have plenty for the duration of your trip . If you ' re going somewhere that ' s hot , look for a cotton - blend mask , which can be cooler and more comfortable . Face masks can help prevent the spread of coronavirus if worn correctly . Make sure the one you ' re wearing is covering your nose and chin and does n ' t create gaps . Masks that use thicker material and designs with more layers might trap larger particles you accidentally eject through talking , coughing or sneezing , but they may also be warmer to wear . < PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 25 NEXT SLIDE > Now that businesses have reopened throughout the US , you may see that most will require you to wear a mask or face covering before entering . Whether you ' re buying a mask or making a homemade face covering , you ' ll need to get one soon if you ' re planning on going anywhere . Here are the masks our CNET editors are wearing when we leave the house . ( These were lovingly made by CNET Senior Managing Editor Dan Ackerman ' s URLTOKEN if you ' re looking for more unique masks , you can find some here . © Provided by CNET 8 . Minimize contact with people not in your immediate group When vacationing , it ' s best to stick with only the people in your household . The more people you come into contact with , the higher your chances are of contracting the virus . If you know you ' ll be going somewhere that has a large number of people , like a major city , wear a mask whenever you leave your accommodations , even to ride an elevator or ride in a taxi cab . Wash your hands often and bring hand sanitizer to areas where a hand - washing station is n ' t provided . If you know you ' ll be frequenting restaurants while on your trip , call ahead to make sure they have outdoor seating . Eating outside is considered much less risky than eating inside because airflow disperses the coronavirus rather than allowing it to collect in a single spot . Remember that even though you ' re outside , you should still wear a mask until your food arrives , especially since you ' ll be in constant contact with your server , who is in turn in constant contact with other members of the public . For more information on COVID - 19 , read up on why we ' re still in the first wave and what happens next . Also , remember that people who are asymptomatic can spread coronavirus . Here ' s how long it takes to get coronavirus test results back .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption

1,Travel Restrictions and Lockdown,Lockdown,statistics,"Though many Americans are growing anxious to resume business as usual , mass protests demanding states ` ` reopen ' ' reflect relatively fringe views , with nationwide polling showing that a majority of Americans fear that reopening their states during the coronavirus pandemic could put them at risk of infection . Roughly 54 per cent of respondents are ` ` very or extremely worried ' ' about reopening spiking infections , while another 29 per cent are ` ` somewhat worried ' ' about the risk . But even as respondents begin considering lifting some restrictions after several weeks of quarantines across the US , half of respondents say that a vaccine is essential before pre - pandemic public life can resume . Echoing results from previous surveys during the ` ` lock - down ' ' period , most respondents said they believe restriction measures have been appropriate . More than half of respondents agreed with the restrictions , while another 27 per cent said they do n ' t go far enough . Only 18 per cent of respondents disagree with the mandates , and 16 per cent said they ' re not concerned at all about infections . The nationwide poll of 1 , 056 adults was conducted between 14 - 18 May . Read our full mailing list consent terms here Support for restrictions overall has slipped within the last month , down from 80 per cent in April to 62 per cent in May , but the report shows that the changing attitudes among Republicans — mirroring demands from right - wing protests and GOP leadership — that have caused the numbers to dip slightly .

1,Travel Restrictions and Lockdown,Lockdown,statistics,"One in eight households has had no access to a garden during the coronavirus lockdown , new figures show . The Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) has released the data after lockdown restrictions were eased in England to allow people to spend more time outside in public spaces . The figures , based on data from Ordnance Survey and Natural England , show that in London 21 per cent of households have no access to private or shared gardens . However , they are the most likely in the country to live near a park . More than a quarter of people ( 28 per cent ) in the UK were found to live within a five - minute walk ( 300m ) of a public park , while 72 per cent live fewer than 15 minutes away ( 900m ) . This rises to 52 per cent and 95 per cent respectively when playing fields are included in the data . The survey also highlighted a stark contrast between the level of access different ethnicities have to an outdoor space . According to the ONS , people from minority ethnic groups are less likely to have access to a private garden . The data shows that black people are nearly four times as likely as white people to have no outdoor space at home , whether that be a private or shared garden , a patio or a balcony ( 37 per cent compared with 10 per cent ) . Read our full mailing list consent terms here Even when the data compared people of a similar age , social grade and living situation , those of black ethnicity were found to be URLTOKEN times less likely than those of white ethnicity to have a private garden . Older people , who are being advised to stay at home as much as possible , were found to be the most likely to have access to a garden , with just eight per cent of over - 65s living without outside space .",B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O O O B-assumption I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O B-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O B-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O B-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O O O O O O O O O O O I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O B-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-assumption I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/coronavirus-uk-lockdown-garden-access-outdoor-space-black-race-ons-a9514766.html

1,Travel Restrictions and Lockdown,Travel,statistics,"Most citizens of top holiday nations do not want UK holidaymakers , a YouGov poll has found . As England prepares to relax quarantine rules for travellers returning from Spain , opinion in the UK ’ s favourite holiday nation appears strongly opposed to British visitors . Sixty - one per cent of Spanish people polled said they did not want UK holidaymakers . That compares with 46 per cent average opposition to tourists from other European countries . The second - most popular nation for British travellers , France , is almost as antagonistic with 55 per cent of respondents unhappy to see UK holidaymakers . The average for other European nationalities is 38 per cent . The only nationalities less popular than the British are Americans and Chinese people . In Italy , though , only 44 per cent of locals are against British visitors ( 10 per cent higher than the average for other travellers from Europe ) . Out of major EU nations , Italians are also the most likely potential visitors to the UK – with 15 per cent saying they would consider visiting this summer . That compares with only 13 per cent of Spanish people , and just five per cent of French citizens . Read our full mailing list consent terms here Danes and Norwegians are almost as reticent , with only six per cent contemplating a visit to Britain . The survey also looked at the UK propensity to travel abroad . Both Spain and France are being considered by 21 per cent of prospective British holidaymakers . The surprise third place is taken by Germany , with 18 per cent of UK travellers considering a visit . They would not , though , be universally welcomed , with 58 per cent of Germans wanting borders closed to British travellers . The impact of the coronavirus crisis is proving devastating .",O I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O B-anecdote I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O O B-assumption I-assumption I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-assumption I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O B-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O B-assumption I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O B-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O O I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O B-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O O O O O O O O O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-assumption I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O B-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O B-assumption I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O,https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/coronavirus-holiday-europe-british-tourists-spain-france-yougov-poll-a9609926.html
0,Travel Restrictions and Lockdown,Lockdown,statistics,"Though many Americans are growing anxious to resume business as usual , mass protests demanding states ` ` reopen ' ' reflect relatively fringe views , with nationwide polling showing that a majority of Americans fear that reopening their states during the coronavirus pandemic could put them at risk of infection . Roughly 54 per cent of respondents are ` ` very or extremely worried ' ' about reopening spiking infections , while another 29 per cent are ` ` somewhat worried ' ' about the risk . But even as respondents begin considering lifting some restrictions after several weeks of quarantines across the US , half of respondents say that a vaccine is essential before pre - pandemic public life can resume . Echoing results from previous surveys during the ` ` lock - down ' ' period , most respondents said they believe restriction measures have been appropriate . More than half of respondents agreed with the restrictions , while another 27 per cent said they do n ' t go far enough . Only 18 per cent of respondents disagree with the mandates , and 16 per cent said they ' re not concerned at all about infections . The nationwide poll of 1 , 056 adults was conducted between 14 - 18 May .

0,Travel Restrictions and Lockdown,Lockdown,statistics,"One in eight households has had no access to a garden during the coronavirus lockdown , new figures show . The Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) has released the data after lockdown restrictions were eased in England to allow people to spend more time outside in public spaces . The figures , based on data from Ordnance Survey and Natural England , show that in London 21 per cent of households have no access to private or shared gardens . However , they are the most likely in the country to live near a park . More than a quarter of people ( 28 per cent ) in the UK were found to live within a five - minute walk ( 300m ) of a public park , while 72 per cent live fewer than 15 minutes away ( 900m ) . This rises to 52 per cent and 95 per cent respectively when playing fields are included in the data . The survey also highlighted a stark contrast between the level of access different ethnicities have to an outdoor space . According to the ONS , people from minority ethnic groups are less likely to have access to a private garden . The data shows that black people are nearly four times as likely as white people to have no outdoor space at home , whether that be a private or shared garden , a patio or a balcony ( 37 per cent compared with 10 per cent ) . Read our full mailing list consent terms here Even when the data compared people of a similar age , social grade and living situation , those of black ethnicity were found to be URLTOKEN times less likely than those of white ethnicity to have a private garden . Older people , who are being advised to stay at home as much as possible , were found to be the most likely to have access to a garden , with just eight per cent of over - 65s living without outside space .",B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O O O B-assumption I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O B-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O B-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O B-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O O O O O O O O O O O I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O B-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-assumption I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics I-statistics O,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/coronavirus-uk-lockdown-garden-access-outdoor-space-black-race-ons-a9514766.html

0,Travel Restrictions and Lockdown,Travel,statistics,"Most citizens of top holiday nations do not want UK holidaymakers , a YouGov poll has found . As England prepares to relax quarantine rules for travellers returning from Spain , opinion in the UK ’ s favourite holiday nation appears strongly opposed to British visitors . Sixty - one per cent of Spanish people polled said they did not want UK holidaymakers . That compares with 46 per cent average opposition to tourists from other European countries . The second - most popular nation for British travellers , France , is almost as antagonistic with 55 per cent of respondents unhappy to see UK holidaymakers . The average for other European nationalities is 38 per cent . The only nationalities less popular than the British are Americans and Chinese people . In Italy , though , only 44 per cent of locals are against British visitors ( 10 per cent higher than the average for other travellers from Europe ) . Out of major EU nations , Italians are also the most likely potential visitors to the UK – with 15 per cent saying they would consider visiting this summer . That compares with only 13 per cent of Spanish people , and just five per cent of French citizens . Read our full mailing list consent terms here Danes and Norwegians are almost as reticent , with only six per cent contemplating a visit to Britain . The survey also looked at the UK propensity to travel abroad . Both Spain and France are being considered by 21 per cent of prospective British holidaymakers . The surprise third place is taken by Germany , with 18 per cent of UK travellers considering a visit . They would not , though , be universally welcomed , with 58 per cent of Germans wanting borders closed to British travellers .

1,Travel Restrictions and Lockdown,Lockdown,testimony,"The document said that easing restrictions ` ` will not mean returning to how things were before the virus ' ' , with social distancing , public health surveillance and enhanced hand hygiene continuing . Further measures will be required to mitigate the lifting of some restrictions , it warned , ` ` to stop cases becoming clusters , clusters becoming outbreaks , and outbreaks becoming an uncontrolled peak ' ' that could overwhelm the NHS . Stating there is ` ` no such thing as a level of ' acceptable loss ' , the blueprint explicitly rejected trying to attain herd immunity by stating that there is no ` ` proportion or section of the population that it is safe or acceptable ' ' to be infected . However , it said that the lockdown will likely be lifted ` ` in a phased manner , opening up different parts of the economy sector by sector , considering different restrictions in different areas dependent on how the pandemic is progressing and considering options for different groups of the population - as is currently the case with those shielded for clinical reasons . ' ' Ms Sturgeon said classrooms could be redesigned to maintain social distancing ` ` so maybe not all children can go back to or be at school at the same times . ' ' Businesses could be reopened , she said , but only if they changed their working practices to keep employees and customers 2m apart . Scotland could ease restrictions or reimpose them at different times from the rest of the UK if necessary , the blueprint said . But Jackson Carlaw , the Scottish Tory leader , said that ` ` in the interests of ensuring clear and consistent advice to the public , the lockdown should be ended on a timeline agreed across all four nations on the UK ' ' in most instances . Tracy Black , CBI Scotland director , said : ` ` Businesses recognise that the lifting of lockdown must be phased and put public health first , but where firms are ready and able to meet social distancing requirements , they should be encouraged to return to operations to protect jobs and the economy . ' ' A Number 10 spokesman on Thursday sought to play down any suggestion that the Scottish Government is taking a different approach to the rest of the UK . He said : ` ` As far as I am aware , the Scottish Government have stressed that they want to continue to operate within a four nations , UK framework and align any decisions that are taken as far as possible . ' ' He said the First Minister ' s blueprint was ` ` based ' ' on the UK Government ' s five tests and all four home nations have ` ` moved together ' ' throughout the outbreak .",B-testimony

1,Travel Restrictions and Lockdown,Lockdown,testimony,"Gov . Andrew M . Cuomo ’ s quarantine order for travelers from 16 high - coronavirus - infection states likely would hold up in court if challenged , legal experts say . But a week after it went into effect , one Long Island state lawmaker said that with enforcement a “ logistical nightmare , ” it ’ s designed to discourage travel rather than impose widespread quarantines . Cuomo , New Jersey Gov . Phil Murphy and Connecticut Gov . Ned Lamont said last week that the tristate travel advisory , which requires 14 days of self - isolation upon arrival in the area , is aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus from states with high , and growing , infection rates . New York has collected information from more than 4 , 600 travelers at airports across the state , said a top Cuomo administration official close to the situation who asked not to be identified . Local health departments are then asked to randomly check to ensure travelers are obeying the quarantine , the official said . The Suffolk County Health Department said in a statement that “ currently , 102 travelers are being monitored ” by contact tracers who will monitor them daily for 14 days , but department officials did not explain how tracers verify that the person is self - isolating . Nassau County phones travelers daily , but asked how to ensure people are truly quarantining , health department spokeswoman Mary Ellen Laurain said , “ We emphasize the importance of the quarantine order and what it means … We ’ re not going door to door . ' ' Nassau is monitoring 70 travelers , she said , adding those are all the names the health department provided . A note to our community : As a public service , this article is available for all . “ These are the people who self - identified and voluntarily filled the out forms , ” Laurain said . Legal experts said the quarantine order does not appear to violate either the state or URLTOKEN constitutions . The URLTOKEN Constitution generally prohibits one state from discriminating against residents of another . But the quarantine does not appear to violate that clause because it applies to tristate residents returning from travels in the 16 states , as well as to residents of other states , said Eric M . Freedman , an expert on URLTOKEN constitutional law at the Hofstra University Maurice A . Deane School of Law . Freedman said “ it ’ s based on objective criteria related to disease , ” infection rates are reviewed regularly , and it does not stop people from traveling . Cuomo cited Article 4 of the state Constitution in his executive order on the quarantine . It “ gives the governor broad power to respond to emergencies , ' ' said Roderick M . Hills Jr . , an expert on local government and constitutional law at New York University . Enforcement details are still fuzzy . Cuomo said last week that passenger arrival data from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey — which operates Kennedy , LaGuardia and Newark airports — would , for example , help police determine if someone they pulled over for a traffic offense may have recently arrived from one of the quarantine states and is violating the order . Yet in a news conference June 25 , a day after Cuomo made the announcement , Port Authority chairman Kevin J . O ’ Toole said he wasn ’ t aware of such a database and emphasized that “ our role is that it ’ ll be informational , ” such as signs placed in airports , and “ we ’ ll leave that to the various states to enforce . ” A Port Authority spokeswoman did not respond to questions on whether such a database was ever created . Nassau and Suffolk officials did not answer queries on whether there ’ s a Port Authority database police can access . Airline passengers are given forms to fill out with personal information — including where they ’ ll be staying in New York — before landing , the Cuomo administration official said . Passengers then voluntarily deposit forms in drop boxes at gates , with some in - person compliance spot checks at gates by state employees , the official said . “ We do not have the personnel to be at every gate every time a flight comes in … , ” the Cuomo administration official said . “ We want everyone to voluntarily comply . ” The official said Long Island MacArthur Airport is one of the participating airports . Caroline Smith , spokeswoman for the Town of Islip , which owns the airport , said Wednesday that MacArthur hadn ’ t been notified about the installation of any drop boxes or visits from state officials . On Thursday evening , though , the state contacted the airport , saying it wants tables and chairs set up to query passengers , Smith said . Representatives for American , Delta and Southwest airlines said passengers are given the forms before they land at a tristate airport . Assemblyman Michael Montesano ( R - Glen Head ) , who supports the quarantine , said enforcement is “ a logistical nightmare . ” Many people arrive in New York by road , bus and train , and , with no checkpoints , “ I really don ’ t see people doing this on a voluntary basis , ' ' he said . “ I think he ’ s trying to discourage people from coming here ” rather than expecting widespread compliance with the quarantine , Montesano said , referring to Cuomo . The Cuomo administration official said travelers arriving by road could call their local health departments or a state hotline to notify the state of their arrival . A similar quarantine that Florida imposed for tristate residents in March remains in effect , even though Florida on Wednesday had more than 11 times as many new coronavirus cases as New York , according to health department data from the two states . Florida has collected more than 209 , 000 traveler forms , from airports as well as interstate checkpoints , a Florida transportation department spokeswoman said .",O O B-assumption I-assumption

1,Travel Restrictions and Lockdown,Lockdown,testimony,"The chief executive officer of Thrive Cannabis Marketplace , Mitch Britten , said he would be “ very happy ” to talk with the county ’ s legal team . He said Strive already operates two of the six licenses it holds in Nevada . According to its website , Thrive has facilities in Las Vegas and Reno . David Poole of Stateline Liquors in Jackpot told commissioners he is interested in a license for a dispensary . He said Scott Matthews of 420ville , a company out of Oregon , has offered him a chance to buy into that company to open one in Jackpot . He said Thursday in a telephone interview that he has been hearing from people all day who were surprised Thrive was interested in coming to Jackpot . He said the “ whole town wants local owners . ” Hannah Roberts , a real estate agent with Bottari and representing 420ville , also told commissioners Wednesday that the community was behind a locally owned dispensary . Commissioner Rex Steninger said he supports a marijuana dispensary as he has done when the question has come before the county in the past , but he said he didn ’ t “ want to hold them hostage at a $ 500 , 000 bond . It might be a deal breaker for whatever company wants to come here . ” Andreozzi said he was “ not stuck on a number ” but wanted a bond .",B-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O B-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O B-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O B-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O B-anecdote I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O B-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O I-testimony B-anecdote I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-anecdote I-testimony I-anecdote I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O B-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O O I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O I-testimony B-anecdote I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O,https://www.magicvalley.com/business/elko-commissioners-allow-jackpot-chance-for-pot-dispensary/article_140176a5-f911-53d4-a364-e08394d75142.html

1,Travel Restrictions and Lockdown,Lockdown,testimony,"The director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday that in order for the country to reopen , swift testing for people who have the virus and for people who might be immune to the virus will need to be available . Robert R . Redfield said on the ` ` TODAY ' ' show that early case identification of the virus will allow for swift isolation and contact tracing that will be needed before social distancing guidelines are loosened . Members of the National Guard at a newly opened coronavirus testing site in Brooklyn , URLTOKEN , on April 11 , 2020 .

' ' ` ` There ' s no doubt that we have to reopen correctly , ' ' Redfield said , adding it would be ` ` a step - by - step gradual process , that ' s got to be data - driven . ' ' Early case identification will help the country ` ` stay open , ' ' Redfield said . He said the country was ` ` nearing the peak , ' ' and would possibly hit it this week .

0,Travel Restrictions and Lockdown,Lockdown,testimony,"The document said that easing restrictions ` ` will not mean returning to how things were before the virus ' ' , with social distancing , public health surveillance and enhanced hand hygiene continuing . Further measures will be required to mitigate the lifting of some restrictions , it warned , ` ` to stop cases becoming clusters , clusters becoming outbreaks , and outbreaks becoming an uncontrolled peak ' ' that could overwhelm the NHS . Stating there is ` ` no such thing as a level of ' acceptable loss ' , the blueprint explicitly rejected trying to attain herd immunity by stating that there is no ` ` proportion or section of the population that it is safe or acceptable ' ' to be infected . However , it said that the lockdown will likely be lifted ` ` in a phased manner , opening up different parts of the economy sector by sector , considering different restrictions in different areas dependent on how the pandemic is progressing and considering options for different groups of the population - as is currently the case with those shielded for clinical reasons . ' ' Ms Sturgeon said classrooms could be redesigned to maintain social distancing ` ` so maybe not all children can go back to or be at school at the same times . ' ' Businesses could be reopened , she said , but only if they changed their working practices to keep employees and customers 2m apart . Scotland could ease restrictions or reimpose them at different times from the rest of the UK if necessary , the blueprint said . But Jackson Carlaw , the Scottish Tory leader , said that ` ` in the interests of ensuring clear and consistent advice to the public , the lockdown should be ended on a timeline agreed across all four nations on the UK ' ' in most instances . Tracy Black , CBI Scotland director , said : ` ` Businesses recognise that the lifting of lockdown must be phased and put public health first , but where firms are ready and able to meet social distancing requirements , they should be encouraged to return to operations to protect jobs and the economy . ' ' A Number 10 spokesman on Thursday sought to play down any suggestion that the Scottish Government is taking a different approach to the rest of the UK . He said : ` ` As far as I am aware , the Scottish Government have stressed that they want to continue to operate within a four nations , UK framework and align any decisions that are taken as far as possible . ' ' He said the First Minister ' s blueprint was ` ` based ' ' on the UK Government ' s five tests and all four home nations have ` ` moved together ' ' throughout the outbreak .",B-testimony

0,Travel Restrictions and Lockdown,Lockdown,testimony,"Gov . Andrew M . Cuomo ’ s quarantine order for travelers from 16 high - coronavirus - infection states likely would hold up in court if challenged , legal experts say . But a week after it went into effect , one Long Island state lawmaker said that with enforcement a “ logistical nightmare , ” it ’ s designed to discourage travel rather than impose widespread quarantines . Cuomo , New Jersey Gov . Phil Murphy and Connecticut Gov . Ned Lamont said last week that the tristate travel advisory , which requires 14 days of self - isolation upon arrival in the area , is aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus from states with high , and growing , infection rates . New York has collected information from more than 4 , 600 travelers at airports across the state , said a top Cuomo administration official close to the situation who asked not to be identified . Local health departments are then asked to randomly check to ensure travelers are obeying the quarantine , the official said . The Suffolk County Health Department said in a statement that “ currently , 102 travelers are being monitored ” by contact tracers who will monitor them daily for 14 days , but department officials did not explain how tracers verify that the person is self - isolating . Nassau County phones travelers daily , but asked how to ensure people are truly quarantining , health department spokeswoman Mary Ellen Laurain said , “ We emphasize the importance of the quarantine order and what it means … We ’ re not going door to door . ' ' Nassau is monitoring 70 travelers , she said , adding those are all the names the health department provided . A note to our community : As a public service , this article is available for all . “ These are the people who self - identified and voluntarily filled the out forms , ” Laurain said . Legal experts said the quarantine order does not appear to violate either the state or URLTOKEN constitutions . The URLTOKEN Constitution generally prohibits one state from discriminating against residents of another . But the quarantine does not appear to violate that clause because it applies to tristate residents returning from travels in the 16 states , as well as to residents of other states , said Eric M . Freedman , an expert on URLTOKEN constitutional law at the Hofstra University Maurice A . Deane School of Law . Freedman said “ it ’ s based on objective criteria related to disease , ” infection rates are reviewed regularly , and it does not stop people from traveling . Cuomo cited Article 4 of the state Constitution in his executive order on the quarantine . It “ gives the governor broad power to respond to emergencies , ' ' said Roderick M . Hills Jr . , an expert on local government and constitutional law at New York University . Enforcement details are still fuzzy . Cuomo said last week that passenger arrival data from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey — which operates Kennedy , LaGuardia and Newark airports — would , for example , help police determine if someone they pulled over for a traffic offense may have recently arrived from one of the quarantine states and is violating the order . Yet in a news conference June 25 , a day after Cuomo made the announcement , Port Authority chairman Kevin J . O ’ Toole said he wasn ’ t aware of such a database and emphasized that “ our role is that it ’ ll be informational , ” such as signs placed in airports , and “ we ’ ll leave that to the various states to enforce . ” A Port Authority spokeswoman did not respond to questions on whether such a database was ever created . Nassau and Suffolk officials did not answer queries on whether there ’ s a Port Authority database police can access . Airline passengers are given forms to fill out with personal information — including where they ’ ll be staying in New York — before landing , the Cuomo administration official said . Passengers then voluntarily deposit forms in drop boxes at gates , with some in - person compliance spot checks at gates by state employees , the official said . “ We do not have the personnel to be at every gate every time a flight comes in … , ” the Cuomo administration official said . “ We want everyone to voluntarily comply . ” The official said Long Island MacArthur Airport is one of the participating airports . Caroline Smith , spokeswoman for the Town of Islip , which owns the airport , said Wednesday that MacArthur hadn ’ t been notified about the installation of any drop boxes or visits from state officials . On Thursday evening , though , the state contacted the airport , saying it wants tables and chairs set up to query passengers , Smith said . Representatives for American , Delta and Southwest airlines said passengers are given the forms before they land at a tristate airport . Assemblyman Michael Montesano ( R - Glen Head ) , who supports the quarantine , said enforcement is “ a logistical nightmare . ” Many people arrive in New York by road , bus and train , and , with no checkpoints , “ I really don ’ t see people doing this on a voluntary basis , ' ' he said . “ I think he ’ s trying to discourage people from coming here ” rather than expecting widespread compliance with the quarantine , Montesano said , referring to Cuomo . The Cuomo administration official said travelers arriving by road could call their local health departments or a state hotline to notify the state of their arrival . A similar quarantine that Florida imposed for tristate residents in March remains in effect , even though Florida on Wednesday had more than 11 times as many new coronavirus cases as New York , according to health department data from the two states . Florida has collected more than 209 , 000 traveler forms , from airports as well as interstate checkpoints , a Florida transportation department spokeswoman said .",O O B-assumption I-assumption

1,Travel Restrictions and Lockdown,Lockdown,common,"On Jan 4 , the Prime Minister announced tough new restrictions , bringing England into its third national lockdown . In his address , Boris Johnson said that the weeks ahead would be the ` ` hardest yet ' ' but added that he believed the country was entering ` ` the last phase of the struggle ' ' . During the first two national lockdowns , exercise was a saving grace for many people stuck inside their homes - so questions remain over whether it is allowed this time around . As part of the new guidelines , you are allowed to exercise outdoors with one other person outside of their household , although this should be limited to once a day and performed locally . This means two people may go for a walk together , but may not sit on a bench for a drink , it is understood . Matt Hancock confirmed on Jan 11 that the exercise rule would not be scrapped after ministers were reported to be considering tightening restrictions . He stressed that this means only one other person , spaced two meters apart , and groups are ` ` not acceptable . ' ' But Mr Hancock said if people continue to break the rules , then they may need to be reviewed , before stressing : ` ` A flex to the rules can be fatal . ` ` If people push the boundaries of these rules or do not take them seriously , that can lead to more cases and that can lead to more deaths . ` ` We keep these things under review and we have demonstrated that we ' re willing to tighten the rules if they need to be tightened , ' ' he told the press conference . However , under the new restrictions gyms will remain closed meaning many of us might be turning to at home workouts once more . Here ' s what the new exercise rules mean in practice . . . Under the new rules , people still have access to outdoor exercise . However , this has to be with members of their household , or one member of another household . The guidelines do n ' t give a time limit for how long you can exercise for , but it should be kept to once a day and undertaken locally . If in doubt , it ' s best to keep your workout short . As in previous lockdowns , the police will have powers to issue fines or dispersal orders if people are caught flouting the rules . All amateur sports are now banned , including outdoor games such as golf and tennis , as well as children ’ s sport . These restrictions are tougher than those set out in Tier 4 , which had instructed indoor gyms and sports facilities to close , but allowed any outdoor sports courts , gyms , swimming pools , archery driving and shooting ranges , riding arenas to remain open . Unlike the first lockdown in March , outdoor playgrounds will remain open . Those in elite sports teams and their coaches , as well as parents of athletes aged under 18 , are still permitted to gather in order to compete and train . Outdoor spaces where you ' re allowed to exercise include neighbourhood streets , parks , beaches , and the countryside , public gardens and grounds ( whether or not you pay to enter them ) , allotments and outdoor playgrounds . However , gyms and indoor workout spaces are closed under the new guidelines .",B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote

1,Travel Restrictions and Lockdown,Lockdown,common,"RIVERSIDE COUNTY , CA — While Riverside County continues on a state watchlist due to its coronavirus uptick that spiked again Friday , nearby Imperial County has been advised by Gov . Gavin Newsom to shut down because of its COVID - 19 crisis . Newsom made the Imperial County announcement during a Friday news briefing , and said he would intervene if the county does not come to a consensus on how to step back and implement a stay - at - home order . Nearly a quarter of those tested for COVID - 19 in Imperial County over the last two weeks have turned up positive , the governor said . Just two hospitals serve Imperial County ' s approximately 181 , 000 people . Federal officials have shipped 80 hospital beds to the region , but the county ` ` simply ca n ' t absorb ' ' the number of COVID - 19 hospitalizations its seeing , Newsom said , noting that its close proximity to Mexico ' s Baja California is complicating matters . Recent reporting indicates Mexicali , which sits just south of the URLTOKEN border , is overburdened with COVID - 19 patients . About 17 patients per day are being shipped out of Imperial to hospitals in surrounding counties , according to Newsom . In total , more than 500 patients from Imperial County have been transported out , he said . As of Friday , the county reports all of its ICU beds are being used . Riverside County has absorbed dozens of Imperial County patients , but only nine are currently hospitalized locally , according to Jose Arballo Jr . , spokesperson for Riverside University Health System - Public Health . As Imperial County grapples with its situation , Riverside County is contending with a rise in COVID - 19 cases and hospitalizations . On Friday , 501 new cases were reported countywide , bringing the total to 15 , 643 . Out of that total number , 7 , 383 people have recovered from the virus , according to county numbers . With 209 , 556 COVID - 19 tests conducted , Riverside County ' s positivity rate has recently been hovering above 10 % , according to Arballo . The most recent RUHS data showed the rate at URLTOKEN on June 19 . The state ' s 14 - day positivity rate increased to URLTOKEN , which the governor called ` ` disturbing . ' ' Hospitalizations increased in Riverside County by seven on Friday to 318 — 105 of them in ICU , which is an uptick of 10 patients since Thursday . Three more county residents have died from COVID - 19 complications , bringing the Riverside County death toll to 438 . On Friday , it was announced that several employees who work and the County Administrative Center in downtown Riverside have tested positive for COVID - 19 , prompting a partial closure of the building and widespread testing .

Los Angeles County , which leads the state in COVID - 19 cases and deaths , is experiencing dramatic daily upticks . On Thursday , the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health warned that the vast majority of bars and restaurants in the county are failing to comply with pandemic safety mandates . At the same time , many LA county residents are n ' t taking basic precautions to protect themselves from coronavirus . Combined with the increase in new cases and hospitalizations , the trend threatens to stall or reverse efforts to reopen the county ' s economy , the agency warned . As the weekend arrives , the governor reminded all California residents that data points show more community spread is occurring on Saturdays and Sundays due to increased gatherings and decreased adherence to safety mandates .

0,Travel Restrictions and Lockdown,Lockdown,common,"On Jan 4 , the Prime Minister announced tough new restrictions , bringing England into its third national lockdown . In his address , Boris Johnson said that the weeks ahead would be the ` ` hardest yet ' ' but added that he believed the country was entering ` ` the last phase of the struggle ' ' . During the first two national lockdowns , exercise was a saving grace for many people stuck inside their homes - so questions remain over whether it is allowed this time around . As part of the new guidelines , you are allowed to exercise outdoors with one other person outside of their household , although this should be limited to once a day and performed locally . This means two people may go for a walk together , but may not sit on a bench for a drink , it is understood . Matt Hancock confirmed on Jan 11 that the exercise rule would not be scrapped after ministers were reported to be considering tightening restrictions . He stressed that this means only one other person , spaced two meters apart , and groups are ` ` not acceptable . ' ' But Mr Hancock said if people continue to break the rules , then they may need to be reviewed , before stressing : ` ` A flex to the rules can be fatal . ` ` If people push the boundaries of these rules or do not take them seriously , that can lead to more cases and that can lead to more deaths . ` ` We keep these things under review and we have demonstrated that we ' re willing to tighten the rules if they need to be tightened , ' ' he told the press conference . However , under the new restrictions gyms will remain closed meaning many of us might be turning to at home workouts once more . Here ' s what the new exercise rules mean in practice . . . Under the new rules , people still have access to outdoor exercise . However , this has to be with members of their household , or one member of another household . The guidelines do n ' t give a time limit for how long you can exercise for , but it should be kept to once a day and undertaken locally . If in doubt , it ' s best to keep your workout short . As in previous lockdowns , the police will have powers to issue fines or dispersal orders if people are caught flouting the rules . All amateur sports are now banned , including outdoor games such as golf and tennis , as well as children ’ s sport . These restrictions are tougher than those set out in Tier 4 , which had instructed indoor gyms and sports facilities to close , but allowed any outdoor sports courts , gyms , swimming pools , archery driving and shooting ranges , riding arenas to remain open . Unlike the first lockdown in March , outdoor playgrounds will remain open . Those in elite sports teams and their coaches , as well as parents of athletes aged under 18 , are still permitted to gather in order to compete and train . Outdoor spaces where you ' re allowed to exercise include neighbourhood streets , parks , beaches , and the countryside , public gardens and grounds ( whether or not you pay to enter them ) , allotments and outdoor playgrounds . However , gyms and indoor workout spaces are closed under the new guidelines .",B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote

0,Travel Restrictions and Lockdown,Lockdown,common,"RIVERSIDE COUNTY , CA — While Riverside County continues on a state watchlist due to its coronavirus uptick that spiked again Friday , nearby Imperial County has been advised by Gov . Gavin Newsom to shut down because of its COVID - 19 crisis . Newsom made the Imperial County announcement during a Friday news briefing , and said he would intervene if the county does not come to a consensus on how to step back and implement a stay - at - home order . Nearly a quarter of those tested for COVID - 19 in Imperial County over the last two weeks have turned up positive , the governor said . Just two hospitals serve Imperial County ' s approximately 181 , 000 people . Federal officials have shipped 80 hospital beds to the region , but the county ` ` simply ca n ' t absorb ' ' the number of COVID - 19 hospitalizations its seeing , Newsom said , noting that its close proximity to Mexico ' s Baja California is complicating matters . Recent reporting indicates Mexicali , which sits just south of the URLTOKEN border , is overburdened with COVID - 19 patients . About 17 patients per day are being shipped out of Imperial to hospitals in surrounding counties , according to Newsom . In total , more than 500 patients from Imperial County have been transported out , he said . As of Friday , the county reports all of its ICU beds are being used . Riverside County has absorbed dozens of Imperial County patients , but only nine are currently hospitalized locally , according to Jose Arballo Jr . , spokesperson for Riverside University Health System - Public Health . As Imperial County grapples with its situation , Riverside County is contending with a rise in COVID - 19 cases and hospitalizations . On Friday , 501 new cases were reported countywide , bringing the total to 15 , 643 . Out of that total number , 7 , 383 people have recovered from the virus , according to county numbers . With 209 , 556 COVID - 19 tests conducted , Riverside County ' s positivity rate has recently been hovering above 10 % , according to Arballo . The most recent RUHS data showed the rate at URLTOKEN on June 19 . The state ' s 14 - day positivity rate increased to URLTOKEN , which the governor called ` ` disturbing . ' ' Hospitalizations increased in Riverside County by seven on Friday to 318 — 105 of them in ICU , which is an uptick of 10 patients since Thursday . Three more county residents have died from COVID - 19 complications , bringing the Riverside County death toll to 438 . On Friday , it was announced that several employees who work and the County Administrative Center in downtown Riverside have tested positive for COVID - 19 , prompting a partial closure of the building and widespread testing . Read more : Riverside County Staffers Test Positive For Coronavirus Along with Riverside and Imperial counties , 13 others are on the state ' s watchlist due to concerns about community spread of the virus . San Bernardino , Los Angeles , Ventura , Santa Barbara , Kern , Fresno , Kings , Tulare , Stanislaus , San Joaquin , Sacramento , Santa Clara , and Contra Costa are also listed . Los Angeles County , which leads the state in COVID - 19 cases and deaths , is experiencing dramatic daily upticks . On Thursday , the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health warned that the vast majority of bars and restaurants in the county are failing to comply with pandemic safety mandates . At the same time , many LA county residents are n ' t taking basic precautions to protect themselves from coronavirus . Combined with the increase in new cases and hospitalizations , the trend threatens to stall or reverse efforts to reopen the county ' s economy , the agency warned . As the weekend arrives , the governor reminded all California residents that data points show more community spread is occurring on Saturdays and Sundays due to increased gatherings and decreased adherence to safety mandates . Face masks are now required statewide with few exceptions , and social distancing of a least 6 feet is also mandated . People in California must wear face coverings when they are in the high - risk situations listed below , according to the state : • Inside of , or in line to enter , any indoor public space ; • Obtaining services from the healthcare sector in settings including , but not limited to , a hospital , pharmacy , medical clinic , laboratory , physician or dental office , veterinary clinic , or blood bank ; 2 • Waiting for or riding on public transportation or paratransit or while in a taxi , private car service , or ride - sharing vehicle ; • Engaged in work , whether at the workplace or performing work off - site , when : • Interacting in - person with any member of the public ; • Working in any space visited by members of the public , regardless of whether anyone from the public is present at the time ; • Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or distribution to others ; • Working in or walking through common areas , such as hallways , stairways , elevators , and parking facilities ; • In any room or enclosed area where other people ( except for members of the person ’ s own household or residence ) are present when unable to physically distance . • Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle , taxi , or private car service or ride - sharing vehicle when passengers are present .

She is the first LPGA player to test positive for COVID - 19 , in pre - tournament testing at Inverness Club . Lopez has been withdrawn from the tournament and is in self - isolation . Tour and health officials are working with her on contact tracing . She was tested on Monday . Full - field tee times from the LPGA Drive On Championship “ I was very excited to get back to playing on tour after this long break and while I ’ m disappointed that I ’ ll have to wait a little longer , I am glad that I was able to get tested and to make sure I do not put anyone else at risk , ” Lopez said in a statement . I ’ m feeling good and looking forward to when I can return to playing on Tour . ” The LPGA will have full pre - tournament testing results for the Drive On Championship later this week . LPGA protocols require Lopez to quarantine for a minimum of 10 days . She will take another saliva test on the 10th day and undergo a medical evaluation to determine if she is cleared to return to competition . Lopez , 26 , a former University of Arkansas standout from Mexico , won the Diamond Resorts Tournament of Champions earlier this year and also the Blue Bay LPGA in 2018 .",B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O I-anecdote B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-assumption I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O,https://sports.yahoo.com/gaby-lopez-first-lpga-player-213310811.html
1,Science and Medicare of COVID,Vaccine,assumption,"A successful Covid - 19 vaccine is today ’ s Holy Grail , a sacred cup that will restore life to what it was if everyone drinks from it . Well , that ’ s the theory anyway . The mere hint that trials from this or that company are looking promising engenders hope , especially on the markets . It ’ s usually good for 100 points or more on top of a frothy FTSE 100 . Hate to rain on everyone ’ s parade , given what a huge shot in the arm ( possibly literally ) the emergence of a working one will be , but it just isn ’ t that simple . To be truly effective , vaccines need to secure mass take up . None of them are 100 per cent effective , and even the best ones are made much less so in the absence of that . There , right there , is the fly in the medicated ointment because securing mass take up looks like it might need some work . A New York Times report chronicling widespread scepticism towards a potential coronavirus vaccine in the US was perhaps the most troubling thing I read over the weekend . The most disturbing part was its finding otherwise rational people , those who ’ d had all their shots and thus wouldn ’ t appear to have much time for the doughnuts who make up the anti - vax “ movement ” , joining the ranks of the sceptics . The polls that have been done make for worrying reading . Read our full mailing list consent terms here The pernicious falsehoods spread by noisy and ignorant anti - vaxxers have , of course , been well chronicled . Social media has been a boon to them but let ’ s be honest here , the “ mainstream ” media has played its part , putting the pedlars of harmful myth up against public health experts and creating a false equivalence between them . Objective fact has too often been sacrificed on the altar of spurious impartiality . But equally as damaging may be a simple lack of trust in the governments that will have to oversee and coordinate a mass vaccination effort . Governments being less than honest isn ’ t anything new , regardless of the party or parties with their hands on the levers of power . What ’ s different about the administrations currently in power in both the US , and in Britain , is the flagrancy with which they scatter falsehoods , which are then gleefully picked up and spread by their supporters . It sometimes seems as if you ’ d get more sense out of a class full of five - year - olds than from one of prime minister Boris Johnson ’ s speeches . Ditto Donald Trump , for whom Johnson too often serves as a blustering mini me , whose pants seem permanently on fire . There is a price to be paid for such casual mendacity , particularly when married to the public ’ s understandable ( given past behaviour ) scepticism towards big pharma . Drug companies are central to the international effort to find a workable vaccine . That said , while we can spend all day analysing the causes of the problem , it ’ s far more important that we treat it . It ’ s true that there are measures that can be taken to force an increase in the uptake of vaccinations . The most obvious is clearly no shot , no school , and maybe the introduction of vaccination certificates . The former may very well be necessary given the capacity that schools , even those which do their utmost to adhere to safety protocols , have when it comes to spreading the thing . Young children are always going to find social distancing a struggle . But while such measures may be necessary , they carry the risk of a backlash , especially in the US , even with that country currently in the unhappy position of being one of the world ’ s coronavirus hot zones . Better a volunteer than a conscript , so now would therefore be a good time to encourage them by addressing the troubling trends in public opinion with research and countermeasures , information films explaining how vaccinations work and why they can be trusted , featuring trusted voices ( so not our lamentable politicians ) , for example . These may be every bit as important as the efforts to find a vaccine in the first place .",B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption

1,Science and Medicare of COVID,Vaccine,assumption,"Yet these pioneering companies have been facing a cliff edge . The model of grant funding offered by CARB - X works well for early stage innovation , where costs are relatively low , but risks are prohibitively high for private investors . Then as these assets progress into bigger - scale development trials , the risks get lower while the costs rocket . In other areas of medical research , this is the point where private investors often take over from philanthropies and public agencies to provide funding . For antibiotics , though , this has not been happening ; with the market broken and failing to deliver dependable returns , private investors have increasingly shunned antibiotic R & D in favour of more lucrative areas . Antibiotic biotechs have become increasingly cash - starved – with some forced to file for bankruptcy – even as their promising new drugs reach market , leaving vital innovation to die on the vine . The joint almost $ 1 billion commitment from the world ’ s leading major pharmaceutical companies to a new investment fund will offer targeted support to these small companies as they go into later stage development . Although the AMR Action Fund will act in many ways like a commercial investor , it will be able to finance projects currently neglected by venture capital , helping small biotechs survive and ensure antibiotics in development have a path to patients in urgent need . After years of accusations that they were acting irresponsibly by neglecting antibiotic R & D , this significant financial commitment by industry leaders shows they understand the importance of what is at stake . It is not , however , the end of the story . The initial investment is a significant sum , but it will only sustain a fraction of the pipeline we need . Even with top - ups from public and philanthropic investors – and help from such partners to maximise impact in a challenging global health landscape – these resources realistically might only shepherd two or three new drugs to market . Long - term sustainability still depends on governments stepping in to fairly incentivise the antibiotic innovation we all need . So far , the calls for them to do so have too often gone unheeded : now it is time for politicians to recognise that like a Covid vaccine , antibiotics are a medical innovation we can ’ t afford to live without .

1,Science and Medicare of COVID,Vaccine,assumption,"Try unravelling that tangled , buggy mess , which looks more like a bowl of angel hair pasta than a finely tuned piece of programming . Industry best practice would have 500 separate files instead . In our commercial reality , we would fire anyone for developing code like this and any business that relied on it to produce software for sale would likely go bust . The approach ignores widely accepted computer science principles known as ` ` separation of concerns ' ' , which date back to the early 70s and are essential to the design and architecture of successful software systems . The principles guard against what developers call CACE : Changing Anything Changes Everything . Without this separation , it is impossible to carry out rigorous testing of individual parts to ensure full working order of the whole . Testing allows for guarantees . It is what you do on a conveyer belt in a car factory . Each and every component is tested for integrity in order to pass strict quality controls . Only then is the car deemed safe to go on the road . As a result , Imperial ’ s model is vulnerable to producing wildly different and conflicting outputs based on the same initial set of parameters . Run it on different computers and you would likely get different results . In other words , it is non - deterministic . As such , it is fundamentally unreliable . It screams the question as to why our Government did not get a second opinion before swallowing Imperial ' s prescription .",B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption O O I-assumption B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O O O O O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption O O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/05/16/neil-fergusons-imperial-model-could-devastating-software-mistake
1,Science and Medicare of COVID,COVID Diagnoise,assumption,"Covid - 19 is not just a respiratory illness . It attacks the heart and kidneys too . Even the brain . It can transform the blood with fatal clots , like flour causing lumpy gravy . No one really knows why . So doctors seeking to treat the sick cast around online , and call colleagues in other hospitals , even other countries , to hear tips and experience which might just help them save a patient . In some places ventilators are now being joined by dialysis machines as vital bits of kit in huge demand . By the time this is over , it will not just be machines that help you breathe that symbolise Covid - 19 , but machines that purify the blood , drugs that thin the blood , infusions that boost your immune response , and also drugs that tamp that immune response down . This , in other words , is no simple disease , no single straightforward condition that needs to be assessed and then defeated . Rather , once it gets a grip , it can become a cascading series of conditions which spread from organ to organ , outrunning doctors and treatments until death arrives . The spectrum of possible reactions to infection is thus immense , from those who are almost completely asymptomatic , to those whose bodies are destroyed from within – who end up with brain inflammation , or die of strokes . Once rooted , Covid - 19 can put our systems under astonishing , multifarious stress . The very idea of a cure , then , seems incredible . A cure for what ? For the blood clots ? For the heart damage ? The cytokine storm whipped up by the immune response ? The symptoms of diabetes in patients who have never before suffered from the condition ? This is not one disease but many , like the serial killer who slips from one disguise to another , taunting those in pursuit by hovering in plain sight , yet ever elusive . No wonder that the principal drugs on which hopes are now pinned seem most to help those whose infection has not got too firm a grip .",B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption O I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption O O O I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O O O O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-assumption O I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O I-assumption O O O O O O O I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O O O O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/02/will-no-quick-cure-covid-19
1,Science and Medicare of COVID,Virus Outbrak/Origin,assumption,"Travel is conditioned in Togo between neighboring states to more than 500 thousand CFA francs in fine for confinement , after a visit to neighboring countries , as if to say neighboring countries are carriers of the virus . This amount of money provides food for thought on the very use of the COVID - 19 virus . For some , the corona serves unacknowledged causes that favor the poverty of the majority at the expense of a minority , so that a social injustice is installed with restriction of freedoms . Actions that resemble gross violations of rights under the guise of scapegoats . ` ` If the world is in danger , the main responsible is China ' ' suggests a diplomat on condition of anonymity . And this is in line with corporate social responsibility to the extent that the companies that produce toxic and contagious products take into account direct and indirect benefits . . . The example of the trafigura case in [UNK] d ' Ivoire where toxic waste was dumped , and the consequences of which were fully taken into account by the company that dumped this toxic waste . Likewise , the handling of viruses in the context of the production of biological weapons must provide for texts so that the direct and indirect consequences are taken into account by the companies which handle these viruses . The present case of the expertise of the pastor institute which is implicated , a French research center which is based in China under the control of the Chinese state . So the problem is there . Why would China not pay the costs allocated to the treatment of corona in the countries victims of this virus from China ? Does the responsibility of the polluter pays apply to China ? The whole world remembers the origin of the crisis with the corona virus , released from the laboratories of China , this virus caused a lot of damage in the world , by the fault of some people whose responsibility is however quite clear . And as a misfortune never happens alone , the precaution to guard against this famous virus which goes around the world , also causes very expensive services for the populations . If for reasons of confinement , people have been killed , the consequences of this disease have not yet ended . Who is the real perpetrator of these killings ? In some countries , measures are very quickly instrumentalized to serve causes that are not yet easily explained . And for the record , the costs of containment are now borne by the victims of this Chinese virus , without the responsibility of China itself being questioned , in any way . It is still more trauma for the world to learn that the victims are being put on the payroll , without a word being said on the responsibility of the perpetrator of this crime against humanity . At this time of financial crisis caused by the corona , the opening of borders which should serve for the economic resilience of populations does not meet expectations . So what is the fault of people who die of hunger and poverty due to inactivity ? It is therefore necessary to define a regulatory framework applicable to stakeholders in the implementation of research policies in the field of biological weapons , and in taking into account responsibility and the pursuit and monitoring of compensation for victims . Without saying so , China has opened a war against freedoms . And it is indeed , a crime similar to the release of toxic sarin gas in metros , except that in this context it is a world under virus . The capture of the organizations and the whole system of global governance demonstrates a real institutional attack , and suggests an insider trading . An act of global terrorism that is not taken in its proper measure And what do Human Rights Defender Organizations do to protect fundamental human rights ? Amnesty International ? The International Criminal Court ? FIDH ? Friends of the Earth ? Doctors Without Borders ? The United Nations ? The Human Right Watch ? The Freedom house ? WHO ? Green peace ?

0,Science and Medicare of COVID,Vaccine,assumption,"A successful Covid - 19 vaccine is today ’ s Holy Grail , a sacred cup that will restore life to what it was if everyone drinks from it . Well , that ’ s the theory anyway . The mere hint that trials from this or that company are looking promising engenders hope , especially on the markets . It ’ s usually good for 100 points or more on top of a frothy FTSE 100 . Hate to rain on everyone ’ s parade , given what a huge shot in the arm ( possibly literally ) the emergence of a working one will be , but it just isn ’ t that simple . To be truly effective , vaccines need to secure mass take up . None of them are 100 per cent effective , and even the best ones are made much less so in the absence of that . There , right there , is the fly in the medicated ointment because securing mass take up looks like it might need some work . A New York Times report chronicling widespread scepticism towards a potential coronavirus vaccine in the US was perhaps the most troubling thing I read over the weekend . The most disturbing part was its finding otherwise rational people , those who ’ d had all their shots and thus wouldn ’ t appear to have much time for the doughnuts who make up the anti - vax “ movement ” , joining the ranks of the sceptics . The polls that have been done make for worrying reading . Read our full mailing list consent terms here The pernicious falsehoods spread by noisy and ignorant anti - vaxxers have , of course , been well chronicled . Social media has been a boon to them but let ’ s be honest here , the “ mainstream ” media has played its part , putting the pedlars of harmful myth up against public health experts and creating a false equivalence between them . Objective fact has too often been sacrificed on the altar of spurious impartiality . But equally as damaging may be a simple lack of trust in the governments that will have to oversee and coordinate a mass vaccination effort . Governments being less than honest isn ’ t anything new , regardless of the party or parties with their hands on the levers of power . What ’ s different about the administrations currently in power in both the US , and in Britain , is the flagrancy with which they scatter falsehoods , which are then gleefully picked up and spread by their supporters . It sometimes seems as if you ’ d get more sense out of a class full of five - year - olds than from one of prime minister Boris Johnson ’ s speeches . Ditto Donald Trump , for whom Johnson too often serves as a blustering mini me , whose pants seem permanently on fire . There is a price to be paid for such casual mendacity , particularly when married to the public ’ s understandable ( given past behaviour ) scepticism towards big pharma . Drug companies are central to the international effort to find a workable vaccine . That said , while we can spend all day analysing the causes of the problem , it ’ s far more important that we treat it . It ’ s true that there are measures that can be taken to force an increase in the uptake of vaccinations . The most obvious is clearly no shot , no school , and maybe the introduction of vaccination certificates . The former may very well be necessary given the capacity that schools , even those which do their utmost to adhere to safety protocols , have when it comes to spreading the thing . Young children are always going to find social distancing a struggle . But while such measures may be necessary , they carry the risk of a backlash , especially in the US , even with that country currently in the unhappy position of being one of the world ’ s coronavirus hot zones . Better a volunteer than a conscript , so now would therefore be a good time to encourage them by addressing the troubling trends in public opinion with research and countermeasures , information films explaining how vaccinations work and why they can be trusted , featuring trusted voices ( so not our lamentable politicians ) , for example . These may be every bit as important as the efforts to find a vaccine in the first place .",B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption

0,Science and Medicare of COVID,Vaccine,assumption,"Yet these pioneering companies have been facing a cliff edge . The model of grant funding offered by CARB - X works well for early stage innovation , where costs are relatively low , but risks are prohibitively high for private investors . Then as these assets progress into bigger - scale development trials , the risks get lower while the costs rocket . In other areas of medical research , this is the point where private investors often take over from philanthropies and public agencies to provide funding . For antibiotics , though , this has not been happening ; with the market broken and failing to deliver dependable returns , private investors have increasingly shunned antibiotic R & D in favour of more lucrative areas . Antibiotic biotechs have become increasingly cash - starved – with some forced to file for bankruptcy – even as their promising new drugs reach market , leaving vital innovation to die on the vine . The joint almost $ 1 billion commitment from the world ’ s leading major pharmaceutical companies to a new investment fund will offer targeted support to these small companies as they go into later stage development . Although the AMR Action Fund will act in many ways like a commercial investor , it will be able to finance projects currently neglected by venture capital , helping small biotechs survive and ensure antibiotics in development have a path to patients in urgent need . After years of accusations that they were acting irresponsibly by neglecting antibiotic R & D , this significant financial commitment by industry leaders shows they understand the importance of what is at stake . It is not , however , the end of the story . The initial investment is a significant sum , but it will only sustain a fraction of the pipeline we need . Even with top - ups from public and philanthropic investors – and help from such partners to maximise impact in a challenging global health landscape – these resources realistically might only shepherd two or three new drugs to market . Long - term sustainability still depends on governments stepping in to fairly incentivise the antibiotic innovation we all need . So far , the calls for them to do so have too often gone unheeded : now it is time for politicians to recognise that like a Covid vaccine , antibiotics are a medical innovation we can ’ t afford to live without .

0,Science and Medicare of COVID,Vaccine,assumption,"Try unravelling that tangled , buggy mess , which looks more like a bowl of angel hair pasta than a finely tuned piece of programming . Industry best practice would have 500 separate files instead . In our commercial reality , we would fire anyone for developing code like this and any business that relied on it to produce software for sale would likely go bust . The approach ignores widely accepted computer science principles known as ` ` separation of concerns ' ' , which date back to the early 70s and are essential to the design and architecture of successful software systems . The principles guard against what developers call CACE : Changing Anything Changes Everything . Without this separation , it is impossible to carry out rigorous testing of individual parts to ensure full working order of the whole . Testing allows for guarantees . It is what you do on a conveyer belt in a car factory . Each and every component is tested for integrity in order to pass strict quality controls . Only then is the car deemed safe to go on the road . As a result , Imperial ’ s model is vulnerable to producing wildly different and conflicting outputs based on the same initial set of parameters . Run it on different computers and you would likely get different results . In other words , it is non - deterministic . As such , it is fundamentally unreliable . It screams the question as to why our Government did not get a second opinion before swallowing Imperial ' s prescription .",B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption O O I-assumption B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O O O O O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption O O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/05/16/neil-fergusons-imperial-model-could-devastating-software-mistake
0,Science and Medicare of COVID,COVID Diagnoise,assumption,"Covid - 19 is not just a respiratory illness . It attacks the heart and kidneys too . Even the brain . It can transform the blood with fatal clots , like flour causing lumpy gravy . No one really knows why . So doctors seeking to treat the sick cast around online , and call colleagues in other hospitals , even other countries , to hear tips and experience which might just help them save a patient . In some places ventilators are now being joined by dialysis machines as vital bits of kit in huge demand . By the time this is over , it will not just be machines that help you breathe that symbolise Covid - 19 , but machines that purify the blood , drugs that thin the blood , infusions that boost your immune response , and also drugs that tamp that immune response down . This , in other words , is no simple disease , no single straightforward condition that needs to be assessed and then defeated . Rather , once it gets a grip , it can become a cascading series of conditions which spread from organ to organ , outrunning doctors and treatments until death arrives . The spectrum of possible reactions to infection is thus immense , from those who are almost completely asymptomatic , to those whose bodies are destroyed from within – who end up with brain inflammation , or die of strokes . Once rooted , Covid - 19 can put our systems under astonishing , multifarious stress . The very idea of a cure , then , seems incredible . A cure for what ? For the blood clots ? For the heart damage ? The cytokine storm whipped up by the immune response ? The symptoms of diabetes in patients who have never before suffered from the condition ? This is not one disease but many , like the serial killer who slips from one disguise to another , taunting those in pursuit by hovering in plain sight , yet ever elusive .

0,Science and Medicare of COVID,Virus Outbrak/Origin,assumption,"Travel is conditioned in Togo between neighboring states to more than 500 thousand CFA francs in fine for confinement , after a visit to neighboring countries , as if to say neighboring countries are carriers of the virus . This amount of money provides food for thought on the very use of the COVID - 19 virus . For some , the corona serves unacknowledged causes that favor the poverty of the majority at the expense of a minority , so that a social injustice is installed with restriction of freedoms . Actions that resemble gross violations of rights under the guise of scapegoats . ` ` If the world is in danger , the main responsible is China ' ' suggests a diplomat on condition of anonymity . And this is in line with corporate social responsibility to the extent that the companies that produce toxic and contagious products take into account direct and indirect benefits . . . The example of the trafigura case in [UNK] d ' Ivoire where toxic waste was dumped , and the consequences of which were fully taken into account by the company that dumped this toxic waste . Likewise , the handling of viruses in the context of the production of biological weapons must provide for texts so that the direct and indirect consequences are taken into account by the companies which handle these viruses . The present case of the expertise of the pastor institute which is implicated , a French research center which is based in China under the control of the Chinese state . So the problem is there . Why would China not pay the costs allocated to the treatment of corona in the countries victims of this virus from China ? Does the responsibility of the polluter pays apply to China ? The whole world remembers the origin of the crisis with the corona virus , released from the laboratories of China , this virus caused a lot of damage in the world , by the fault of some people whose responsibility is however quite clear . And as a misfortune never happens alone , the precaution to guard against this famous virus which goes around the world , also causes very expensive services for the populations . If for reasons of confinement , people have been killed , the consequences of this disease have not yet ended . Who is the real perpetrator of these killings ? In some countries , measures are very quickly instrumentalized to serve causes that are not yet easily explained . And for the record , the costs of containment are now borne by the victims of this Chinese virus , without the responsibility of China itself being questioned , in any way . It is still more trauma for the world to learn that the victims are being put on the payroll , without a word being said on the responsibility of the perpetrator of this crime against humanity . At this time of financial crisis caused by the corona , the opening of borders which should serve for the economic resilience of populations does not meet expectations . So what is the fault of people who die of hunger and poverty due to inactivity ? It is therefore necessary to define a regulatory framework applicable to stakeholders in the implementation of research policies in the field of biological weapons , and in taking into account responsibility and the pursuit and monitoring of compensation for victims . Without saying so , China has opened a war against freedoms . And it is indeed , a crime similar to the release of toxic sarin gas in metros , except that in this context it is a world under virus . The capture of the organizations and the whole system of global governance demonstrates a real institutional attack , and suggests an insider trading . An act of global terrorism that is not taken in its proper measure And what do Human Rights Defender Organizations do to protect fundamental human rights ? Amnesty International ? The International Criminal Court ? FIDH ? Friends of the Earth ? Doctors Without Borders ? The United Nations ? The Human Right Watch ? The Freedom house ? WHO ? Green peace ? [UNK] Those responsible for the spread of the corona virus must be held accountable .",B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption

1,Science and Medicare of COVID,Vaccine,testimony,"Oxford University and Astrazenaca ' s Covid vaccine ( AZD1222 ) was developed without taking any shortcuts even though the process was expedited , said a leading researcher who is working on the vaccine . Professor Andrew Pollard from the Oxford Research Group told India Today TV News Director Rahul Kanwal that all precautions have been taken and the speed of the vaccine development will not affect the product in any way . When asked whether rushing the process of trials could impact the overall vaccine development , Pollard said , ` ` There have n ' t been any shortcuts so the quality of the product is looked at exactly the same way . And the clinical trials are conducted with the same scrutiny that they would be amid normal times . ' ' Also Read | Oxford coronavirus vaccine reached first milestone , need to scale up production : Lead Oxford researcher Pollard said independent safety reviews are happening very frequently as well as regulatory oversight from all over the world . ` ` The process that is being undertaken is not very different , it is just happening at an accelerated pace , ' ' he said . Pollard , however , agreed that there is one issue with determining long - term risks because there is very little data as of now . ` ` We do n ' t have long - term data from even a small number of individuals because in a pandemic you do n ' t have time for that . I think we have one particular advantage that this type of vaccine has been used quite widely before , ' ' Pollard said . While Pollard said it is important to keep monitoring the vaccine over a longer period of time , he said the team is confident that ` ` this is the right direction of travel ' ' at the moment . During the interview , Pollard also said that Oxford researchers have reached the first big milestone with the research . He said now the onus is on pharmaceutical companies to boost production . ` ` We have arrived at the first big milestone in vaccine development , which is showing that the vaccine makes the right responses and generating antibody responses . We still have to prove that the vaccine actually works and protects people , ' ' said Andrew Pollard , director of the Oxford vaccine group . On Monday , a study published in the medical journal Lancet said Oxford University ' s novel coronavirus vaccine candidate showed promise in phase I / II human trials . It noted that Oxford ' s coronavirus vaccine was shown to be safe and was able to induce an immune response against the deadly virus in initial trails .

1,Science and Medicare of COVID,COVID Diagnoise,testimony,"To avoid the spread of the coronavirus through aged care facilities , staff must be able to rapidly implement an action plan to isolate residents , according to National Seniors Australia CEO Professor John McCallum . He said people should have learnt from the Newmarch House incident in NSW and implemented better security measures in order to limit the spread of the virus once it has entered a given facility . Speaking of the recent deaths of elderly Victorian residents , Professor McCallum said “ this should be going better than it is ” . He said the rapid movement of the virus through aged care facilities in Victoria was most likely due to pre - prepared 24 - hour action plans not being implemented quickly enough . “ What happens in a crisis is people don ’ t act as well as they should , ” he told Sky News Chris Kenny",O O O I-assumption O O I-testimony I-assumption I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O B-anecdote I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O B-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O B-anecdote I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O B-testimony B-assumption I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony,https://www.msn.com/en-au/news/australia/aged-care-facilities-not-acting-quickly-enough-to-stop-the-spread-of-covid-19/ar-BB177Yv9
1,Science and Medicare of COVID,Virus Outbrak/Origin,testimony,"© Alex Wong Image : Dr . Anthony Fauci listens during a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House on April 9 , 2020 . Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation ' s top infectious disease expert , said Tuesday that the unique qualities of the ` ` unprecedented ' ' novel coronavirus that helped it ` ` explode ' ' into a global pandemic represent the kind of nightmarish scenario that keeps him up at night . ` ` What keeps me up at night is the emergence of a brand new infection , likely jumping species from an animal , that ' s respiratory born , highly transmissible , with a high degree of morbidity and mortality . And , lo and behold , that ' s where we are right now , ' ' Fauci said during a livestreamed interview Tuesday with The Economic Club of Washington , URLTOKEN ` ` And the reason it ' s so unprecedented , it exploded upon us . ' ' ` ` Everyone is at risk , ' ' the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said . ` ` With this , everyone seems vulnerable , with a disease that ' s highly transmissible . ' ' ` ` This is really unprecedented , ' ' he added . Fauci said the illness ` ` exploded in a way that ' s been unprecedented in a compact period of time . ' ' Bing COVID - 19 tracker : Latest numbers by country and state Later in the interview , Fauci reiterated his view that the pandemic will persist through the fall . ` ` I ' m almost certain it will come back . The virus is so transmissible , ' ' he said . ` ` In my mind , it ' s inevitable that we will have a return of the virus or that maybe it never went away . ' ' He added that it will come down to ` ` how we handle it ' ' in the fall that ` ` will determine our fate . ' ' ` ` If by that time we have put into place all of the countermeasures … if we address that , we will do reasonably well , ' ' he said . ` ` If we do n ' t do that , we could be in for a bad fall and a bad winter . ' ' At the same time , Fauci repeated his view that a widely available vaccine wo n ' t be available for at least ` ` likely a year to a year and a half . ' ' ` ` Hopefully by that time we get to this coming winter , we will know whether we have a safe and effective vaccine , ' ' he said . ` ` The challenge would then be to scale it up .

0,Science and Medicare of COVID,Vaccine,testimony,"Oxford University and Astrazenaca ' s Covid vaccine ( AZD1222 ) was developed without taking any shortcuts even though the process was expedited , said a leading researcher who is working on the vaccine . Professor Andrew Pollard from the Oxford Research Group told India Today TV News Director Rahul Kanwal that all precautions have been taken and the speed of the vaccine development will not affect the product in any way . When asked whether rushing the process of trials could impact the overall vaccine development , Pollard said , ` ` There have n ' t been any shortcuts so the quality of the product is looked at exactly the same way . And the clinical trials are conducted with the same scrutiny that they would be amid normal times . ' ' Also Read | Oxford coronavirus vaccine reached first milestone , need to scale up production : Lead Oxford researcher Pollard said independent safety reviews are happening very frequently as well as regulatory oversight from all over the world . ` ` The process that is being undertaken is not very different , it is just happening at an accelerated pace , ' ' he said . Pollard , however , agreed that there is one issue with determining long - term risks because there is very little data as of now . ` ` We do n ' t have long - term data from even a small number of individuals because in a pandemic you do n ' t have time for that . I think we have one particular advantage that this type of vaccine has been used quite widely before , ' ' Pollard said . While Pollard said it is important to keep monitoring the vaccine over a longer period of time , he said the team is confident that ` ` this is the right direction of travel ' ' at the moment . During the interview , Pollard also said that Oxford researchers have reached the first big milestone with the research . He said now the onus is on pharmaceutical companies to boost production . ` ` We have arrived at the first big milestone in vaccine development , which is showing that the vaccine makes the right responses and generating antibody responses . We still have to prove that the vaccine actually works and protects people , ' ' said Andrew Pollard , director of the Oxford vaccine group . On Monday , a study published in the medical journal Lancet said Oxford University ' s novel coronavirus vaccine candidate showed promise in phase I / II human trials . It noted that Oxford ' s coronavirus vaccine was shown to be safe and was able to induce an immune response against the deadly virus in initial trails .

He said people should have learnt from the Newmarch House incident in NSW and implemented better security measures in order to limit the spread of the virus once it has entered a given facility . Speaking of the recent deaths of elderly Victorian residents , Professor McCallum said “ this should be going better than it is ” . He said the rapid movement of the virus through aged care facilities in Victoria was most likely due to pre - prepared 24 - hour action plans not being implemented quickly enough . “ What happens in a crisis is people don ’ t act as well as they should , ” he told Sky News Chris Kenny",O O O I-assumption O O I-testimony I-assumption I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O B-anecdote I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O B-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O B-anecdote I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O B-testimony B-assumption I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony,https://www.msn.com/en-au/news/australia/aged-care-facilities-not-acting-quickly-enough-to-stop-the-spread-of-covid-19/ar-BB177Yv9
0,Science and Medicare of COVID,Virus Outbrak/Origin,testimony,"© Alex Wong Image : Dr . Anthony Fauci listens during a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House on April 9 , 2020 . Dr . Anthony Fauci , the nation ' s top infectious disease expert , said Tuesday that the unique qualities of the ` ` unprecedented ' ' novel coronavirus that helped it ` ` explode ' ' into a global pandemic represent the kind of nightmarish scenario that keeps him up at night . ` ` What keeps me up at night is the emergence of a brand new infection , likely jumping species from an animal , that ' s respiratory born , highly transmissible , with a high degree of morbidity and mortality . And , lo and behold , that ' s where we are right now , ' ' Fauci said during a livestreamed interview Tuesday with The Economic Club of Washington , URLTOKEN ` ` And the reason it ' s so unprecedented , it exploded upon us . ' ' ` ` Everyone is at risk , ' ' the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said . ` ` With this , everyone seems vulnerable , with a disease that ' s highly transmissible . ' ' ` ` This is really unprecedented , ' ' he added . Fauci said the illness ` ` exploded in a way that ' s been unprecedented in a compact period of time . ' ' Bing COVID - 19 tracker : Latest numbers by country and state Later in the interview , Fauci reiterated his view that the pandemic will persist through the fall . ` ` I ' m almost certain it will come back . The virus is so transmissible , ' ' he said . ` ` In my mind , it ' s inevitable that we will have a return of the virus or that maybe it never went away . ' ' He added that it will come down to ` ` how we handle it ' ' in the fall that ` ` will determine our fate . ' ' ` ` If by that time we have put into place all of the countermeasures … if we address that , we will do reasonably well , ' ' he said . ` ` If we do n ' t do that , we could be in for a bad fall and a bad winter . ' ' At the same time , Fauci repeated his view that a widely available vaccine wo n ' t be available for at least ` ` likely a year to a year and a half . ' ' ` ` Hopefully by that time we get to this coming winter , we will know whether we have a safe and effective vaccine , ' ' he said . ` ` The challenge would then be to scale it up .

1,Science and Medicare of COVID,Vaccine,common,"AUGUSTA , Maine ( AP ) — A water district in Maine is collecting sewage samples for testing to determine the prevalence of the coronavirus based on what ’ s being flushed down the toilet . The Greater Augusta Utility District began collecting samples of sewage this week at its wastewater treatment plant . Those samples are being sent to a Massachusetts company that ’ s pioneering efforts to test for traces of the coronavirus in sewage collected from treatment plants . The data could provide information on how widespread the virus is in the local population , and could aid local officials in their decision making , the Kennebec Journal reported . Most data on the spread of the coronavirus currently comes from individual testing . The water district , using Keep Maine Healthy funding obtained by the city of Augusta , hopes to take advantage of another measure of the virus ’ prevalence , or lack thereof , in a community .

With coronavirus response stimulus spending approaching $ URLTOKEN trillion and a projected budget deficit of $ URLTOKEN trillion this year , it is inevitable that Congress will soon dust off its scissors and begin the exercise of budget cutting . The first place lawmakers are likely to look is national defense . That would be a mistake . Before engaging in another round of budget battles and debt - limit standoffs , Congress ought to look back a decade to the last time the country tried to get serious about our spending problem . If fiscal hawks were the winners of the last budget battle ( a debatable point ) that gave us sequestration and budget caps , our national defense infrastructure was without question the biggest loser . CORONAVIRUS ' DEBT BOMB ' : REPUBLICANS CONCERNED ABOUT MILITARY FUNDING Here are a few lessons for those years the green eyeshades ought to keep in mind as they strike back at federal spending . Defense cuts do not result in defense reform Budget cuts have rarely , if ever , led to the necessary and important objective of reforming the Pentagon . The cuts are seldom applied in a strategic fashion , and so result in indiscriminate and incoherent applications that lead to a weakened force . Under financial strain , Pentagon leaders spend all their efforts on how to say alive rather than figuring out how to get healthier . Unable to maintain its readiness and sustain the operational tempo levied by its political masters in the aftermath of the Great Recession , the military paid the price in the form of training and operational mishaps and , tragically , deaths . According to one report , annual accidents in the Navy ’ s aviation fleet increased 82 percent between 2013 and 2017 , with 133 service members killed in accidents involving Navy jets . The effects of budget cuts and caps contributed to the Trump administration ’ s objective of “ rebuilding the military . ” The rebuild isn ’ t just about dollars – it ’ s about reforming the enterprise for 21st century warfare . It remains unclear whether the military has indeed been rebuilt , but reducing military budgets in the aftermath of COVID - 19 will certainly reverse the recovery our military has enjoyed over the past three years . Strengthening the force and modernizing its platforms requires sustained investments over at least six years . Starving the pump after priming it inevitably leads to lost investments and a hollow force . Be wary of solutions that promise strategic results for pennies on the dollar Even more so now than during President Barack Obama ’ s administration , it is fashionable to promise that new technologies will transform the way the military fights at a fraction of the price . This may be true in the future , but it is not yet the case . Trading an aircraft carrier today for a PowerPoint slide that promises a new technology tomorrow is a recipe for defeat . This is true when defense budgets are growing at a modest rate ; it is doubly true when the military is stretched and hungry for resources . If you are going to reduce military spending , then change your strategy While it is common for policymakers to advocate spending less on defense , it rarely results in a president asking the military to do less . In fact , the opposite is usually true : the military will be asked to do more with less . Whether it was defeating Al Qaeda and ISIS , deterring Iran and Russia , operations in Libya , or pivoting to Asia , the years of budget - cutting did not see a reduction in military operations . Instead , they led to an overtaxed force with degraded equipment unable to meet the demands of the commander in chief . It is , of course , understandable that a president would prefer not to change his strategy based on fiscal considerations . After all , our enemies and adversaries don ’ t take a knee while the URLTOKEN pauses investing in its military . The lesson here is the enemy has a vote . During the years of budget caps and sequestration , our adversaries – including China and Russia – exploited the opening with remarkable speed . As URLTOKEN military deterrence degraded , we found ourselves confronting near - peer competitors capable of beating us in a fight . President Trump ’ s national security strategy , with its emphasis on great power competition – particularly with China – was clear - eyed about these developments . It employed a strategy aimed at arresting these trends . Failing to adequately resource the military would abandon that strategy and undermine the most significant national security contribution of President Trump ’ s first term . Which leads to a final lesson from our last attempt to reign in federal spending on the backs of the military : Only the commander in chief can protect the military from death by a thousand budget cuts The president has the ability to continue rebuilding our national defense infrastructure and keeping the American people safe by requesting military budgets that sustain his strategy and by making clear in word and deed ( via the veto pen ) that he will not tolerate congressional mischief . CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Failure to take these actions will give tacit approval to Congress to take the military ’ s money and run . Unfortunately , early indicators suggest President Trump may allow just that . If the commander in chief can ’ t find his voice and pen , history may end up repeating itself .

1,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,assumption,"( Bloomberg Opinion ) - - Both the Federal Reserve and the White House are considering emergency measures to combat the economic fallout from the coronavirus . These are the right responses , but they don ’ t go far enough . To be clear , the coronavirus is first and foremost a public - health threat . The full resources of the federal government should be marshaled against it . At the same time , the government shouldn ’ t focus only on public health , and it ’ s wrong to argue that efforts to address the economic effects of the virus are a distraction . The underlying theory seems to be that there are only two possible outcomes of the coronavirus outbreak . Either the URLTOKEN will adequately address the public health threat , in which case emergency economic measures will not be needed ; or the URLTOKEN will fail to prevent a pandemic , in which case they will be useless . This thinking is mistaken . Yes , if there is a pandemic , the human toll will exceed the economic toll — but the economic toll can not be ignored . The URLTOKEN would be facing a severe recession , and efforts to mitigate it could help reduce the number of families faced with the double crisis of illness and unemployment . The very responses necessary to stem the crisis — quarantines , shutting down workplaces , avoiding crowds , and the like — will take a toll on the economy . There is also the possibility that , even if a pandemic is avoided , pockets of the virus will continue to emerge until an effective vaccine can be developed . That scenario would create a constant level of fear that is itself depressing to economic growth . Another drag on growth would be the disruption to global trade as the coronavirus spreads to less prepared nations . All these effects could be enough to push the URLTOKEN into a recession . And once a recession hits , the Fed lacks the tools to easily pull the URLTOKEN out . The prudent course , then , is to take action now . In 2007 , as the global financial crisis was unfolding , the Fed repeatedly relied on half measures until it became clear that the financial sector would fall apart . And the White House ’ s response to the recession was a stimulus that was both inadequate and larded with political favors . Those mistakes should not be repeated . The Fed should immediately cut interest rates by half a percentage point . It should then prepare both to cut interest rates all the way to zero at its March meeting and to outline the extraordinary measures , such as quantitative easing and yield - curve control , that it is prepared to employ if the crises worsens . The White House should send an economic aid package to Congress that includes not only the type of payroll and investment tax relief that Republicans support , but also the social spending and state aid that Democrats support . Including spending provisions would serve two functions . One , it would make the package larger and its impact stronger . Two , it would prevent the package from getting bogged down in partisanship . It would thus avoid a crucial defect of former President Barack Obama ’ s stimulus , which sparked a conservative backlash by failing to include the type of tax cuts that could have earned it Republican support . It ’ s possible that these measures would be overkill . Even if so , the downside is small . At worst , aggressive aid would overstimulate the economy and produce a little inflation . But inflation has been below target for a decade . A tax cut and spending package would also add to the deficit . But it would create far less debt than a prolonged recession . The public health response to the coronavirus has to be the government ’ s top priority . Yet an economic response is also necessary . To be effective , it must be swift , sizable and bipartisan . Otherwise , the URLTOKEN risks slipping into another long recession . To contact the author of this story : Karl W .

1,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,assumption,"The coronavirus pandemic has wrecked the economies of US states . Already there is substantial discourse surrounding the need for the federal government to coordinate “ bailouts ” . Indeed , automatic stabilisers such as federal unemployment payments have already kicked in , with some 26 million new applications for unemployment benefits . In the short - term , states such as New York which have been most adversely affected by this virus will require the most assistance . However , in the mid to long - term , as the whole US economy settles into a sort of induced hibernation , all states are likely to require help . It has long been the case that blue states have subsidized the state budgets of red states , whatever Mitch McConnell says . This presents a challenge to the traditional Republican claim to be the party of fiscal responsibility , with the low income tax rates offered by Republican lawmakers being paid for by the financial prudence of Democratic politicians . The tax structure of blue and red states will exacerbate this issue as lockdowns continue . Of the ‘ Big Four ’ ( California , Florida , New York and Texas ) , the two red states are likely to see their state finances thrown into the greatest turmoil . This is because Texas and Florida make up their state budgets with sales taxes ( and no one is buying anything ) while California and New York rely on taxes on incomes ( which will decline during coronavirus , but will not drop off altogether since most high earners are able to work from home ) . A few financially reckless states turning to their more thrifty peers for a bailout is somewhat reminiscent of the Eurozone crisis of the early 2010s . The major difference is that while southern European states ran up large and unsustainable debts in order to finance public spending , Republican states have used federal aid to allow for low tax rates without taking too large a cut out of public services . However , while states can ’ t really go into debt ( meaning they can ’ t declare bankruptcy , again in spite of McConnell ’ s current proposal ) , the response to the shortcomings of Republican state legislators and governors will mirror the aid given to southern European states during the Eurozone crisis . The real difference will likely be in how bailouts are portrayed in the US . While southern European economies have endured unfavorable comparisons to more financially stable northern European countries , Republicans have long falsely claimed that it is in fact red states which fund the financial recklessness of blue states . For a long time , this narrative was left unchallenged ; however , in the current situations , Democrats and in particular Gov . Andrew Cuomo have publicly hit back whenever it ’ s been wheeled out to appease ( or rile up ) Republican voters . There ’ s a chance people will start to see beyond the spin and that the narrative may soon completely collapse . If Democrats are going to start claiming the role of the fiscally responsible party , there are a number of lessons they might learn from the Eurozone crisis . For one , the bailouts given to southern European states came with the condition that countries receiving aid would have to get their finances in order , mainly by cutting government spending . If Democrats demand that red states get their houses in order ( which does seem reasonable ) , it is likely that Republican legislators will cut public services rather than impose income taxes . Such cuts to state spending would place the burden of financial stability on the shoulders of the poorest , while state legislators would be safe in the knowledge that they could blame Congress for such cuts . The main lesson Democrats should learn from the Eurozone crisis , though , is not from the bailouts for southern European states but from the response to the austerity measures that went with them . In the later half of the 2010s , resentment in many European countries gave way to outright rejection of the European Union project . These frustrations have gradually led to a lessening of the fiscal restraints pushed for by Germany and other northern European countries . The coronavirus pandemic seems to have completely undone them . While it may be fiscally prudent for Democrats in Washington to tie bailouts to demands for financial reforms , this will likely lead only to short - lived reforms as red state politicians inevitably lead a backlash against such measures . Read our full mailing list consent terms here Instead , Democrats should seek to change the narrative surrounding state finances . Democrats need to more forcefully show that the tax structures of blue states lead to greater stability than the system favoured in red states . They should also use this as an opportunity to show that a system which favors public services funded by income taxes is not only possible but practical — especially in unforeseen situations and emergencies .",B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption

1,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,assumption,"© Alex Brandon / AP President Donald Trump speaks with reporters before departing on Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House , Tuesday , June 23 , 2020 , in Washington . For many , the Covid - 19 pandemic has exposed the weakness of our federal government . The question is what could be done about it , and how it could be done in a way that strengthens democracy instead of undermining it . There are several paths that we could take in response to this crisis , and only one of them is desirable - - strengthening the federal government by first making investments to reduce distrust among the citizenry . The United States has a form of government where a great deal of power rests with state and local authorities , even when compared to many other contemporary democracies such as France or the United Kingdom . That ' s a product of the way our country was first settled by Europeans , often in in small communities amidst a vast wilderness where strong central control , either from England or from capitals of the colonies , simply was n ' t feasible . This helped pave the way not only for an American tradition of rugged individualism but also for an early form of democracy - - for free White males - - based on local control with a weak center . There was nothing unique or miraculous about the pattern of early democracy in America . Prior to European conquest , Native American societies in the woodlands of eastern North America had organized themselves along exactly the same lines , and the same had been true for many other societies throughout history , from ancient Mesopotamia to pre - colonial Africa . The lesson in all of these societies was simple : Place power in small communities and minimize central control to avoid autocracy . In my new book , I show just how widespread this phenomenon of early democracy was . Now , the big challenge for all democracies with such decentralized institutions is that sometimes central coordination and control is actually helpful , say to provide for external defense , or to facilitate economic development , or maybe even in the face of a pandemic to make sure that nurses do n ' t have to wear garbage bags in place of standard protective equipment . It can actually be a good thing to have an effective central state . In the United States today we are in the process of learning how 40 years of an ideology bent on undercutting our government ` ` in Washington ' ' has eroded central power just when we could have most used it to provide a coordinated response to Covid - 19 . So , what does this mean for the future of our democracy ? The potential risk with increased central control has always been that it will give way to the decline of democracy and the rise of autocracy . Throughout history , emergencies involving famine , pestilence and war have given a window to would - be autocrats to assert themselves , build strong central state institutions , and dispense with any need for consulting the people . Today , from Hungary to Cambodia , autocrats are hoping the current pandemic produces precisely this same outcome . To consider what history says about this possibility , take the case of Prussia . Prior to the Thirty Years ' War ( 1618 - 1648 ) , which spread violence , famine , and pestilence , governance in Prussia had resembled that in many other areas of Western Europe . There were representative assemblies that checked the power of rulers , and towns had a degree of autonomy . This was not democracy as we would think of it today , but it was a far cry from the type of centralized autocracy one would have seen in China at the time under the Ming dynasty . The crisis of the Thirty Years ' War gave an opening for Prussia ' s rulers , the Hohenzollerns , to construct a new form of centralized , bureaucratic state that would dispense with any need for consultation of the people or their representatives . This new state proved effective in many ways , but it also set the country on an autocratic trajectory that would not truly be ended until the official abolition of the State of Prussia by the Allied Control Council on February 25 , 1947 , in the wake of Germany ' s defeat in World War II . It was a model that deprived people of their freedom in what German historian Otto Hintze referred to as a ` ` police state . ' ' Does Prussian experience suggest what could happen in the United States if we strengthened our central state institutions ? Probably not . The most obvious reason for this is that Covid at its worst will be much less destructive than the Thirty Years ' War , but there is also a deeper factor pushing in the same direction . Democratic practices in the United States emerged long before a central state first developed , and at each moment of state strengthening , from the Constitution to the New Deal , representatives of the people have played a fundamental role in shaping the new state institutions rather than having them be imposed in top - down fashion . We can hope that this pattern continues . So , could we see a second , positive path for the United States where democracy is preserved and central state institutions are strengthened in response to better deal with the next pandemic ? Perhaps . But there ' s also a risk of a third , less positive trajectory : Our democracy will survive , but it will also keep failing to do what we want . To see this , take a look at the evidence on which parts of our government are trusted today . We know that in the current crisis , many state governors like Andrew Cuomo are getting better marks for their efforts than is Donald Trump as President . While much of this has to do with the individual personalities involved , this phenomenon also has deeper roots , and it tells us much about the challenge facing American democracy today . It has actually been decades now - - through presidential administrations of both parties - - that there has been substantially lower trust in the federal government compared to state and local governments . The evidence on trust at different levels of government suggests that we in the United States have not escaped a fundamental constraint ; across the broad sweep of human history , democratic governance has been most successful as a small - scale affair . Contrary to what James Madison told us in Federalist 10 , the US Constitution did not solve the problem of maintaining democracy over such a large territory . The big problem for large republics is to avoid having their citizens become distrustful of a distant center , a phenomenon that goes hand in hand with polarization . Thinkers in the early republic soon recognized their predicament , as did Madison himself after the founding . Members of Congress set about trying to address this threat through investments such as the subsidized distribution of newspapers - - so that people would have better information - - and state governments began to provide funding for common schools where people could be educated to participate in democratic governance . The lesson from the early republic is clear : Large scale is a challenge for a democracy , but this obstacle can be overcome . If we are to hope to strengthen our institutions to deal with the next pandemic , or the next emergency , then we need to first think about how we can invest anew in connecting citizens to government . One idea here is to draw directly on early 19th - century experience and invest anew in civic education , a subject that has been given short shrift of late . If we do this then we will have to also recognize that as was the case two centuries ago , this will not happen on its own . It is the government itself that will need to make the effort .",B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote

0,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,assumption,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox . With coronavirus response stimulus spending approaching $ URLTOKEN trillion and a projected budget deficit of $ URLTOKEN trillion this year , it is inevitable that Congress will soon dust off its scissors and begin the exercise of budget cutting . The first place lawmakers are likely to look is national defense . That would be a mistake . Before engaging in another round of budget battles and debt - limit standoffs , Congress ought to look back a decade to the last time the country tried to get serious about our spending problem . If fiscal hawks were the winners of the last budget battle ( a debatable point ) that gave us sequestration and budget caps , our national defense infrastructure was without question the biggest loser . CORONAVIRUS ' DEBT BOMB ' : REPUBLICANS CONCERNED ABOUT MILITARY FUNDING Here are a few lessons for those years the green eyeshades ought to keep in mind as they strike back at federal spending . Defense cuts do not result in defense reform Budget cuts have rarely , if ever , led to the necessary and important objective of reforming the Pentagon . The cuts are seldom applied in a strategic fashion , and so result in indiscriminate and incoherent applications that lead to a weakened force . Under financial strain , Pentagon leaders spend all their efforts on how to say alive rather than figuring out how to get healthier . Unable to maintain its readiness and sustain the operational tempo levied by its political masters in the aftermath of the Great Recession , the military paid the price in the form of training and operational mishaps and , tragically , deaths . According to one report , annual accidents in the Navy ’ s aviation fleet increased 82 percent between 2013 and 2017 , with 133 service members killed in accidents involving Navy jets . The effects of budget cuts and caps contributed to the Trump administration ’ s objective of “ rebuilding the military . ” The rebuild isn ’ t just about dollars – it ’ s about reforming the enterprise for 21st century warfare . It remains unclear whether the military has indeed been rebuilt , but reducing military budgets in the aftermath of COVID - 19 will certainly reverse the recovery our military has enjoyed over the past three years . Strengthening the force and modernizing its platforms requires sustained investments over at least six years . Starving the pump after priming it inevitably leads to lost investments and a hollow force . Be wary of solutions that promise strategic results for pennies on the dollar Even more so now than during President Barack Obama ’ s administration , it is fashionable to promise that new technologies will transform the way the military fights at a fraction of the price . This may be true in the future , but it is not yet the case . Trading an aircraft carrier today for a PowerPoint slide that promises a new technology tomorrow is a recipe for defeat . This is true when defense budgets are growing at a modest rate ; it is doubly true when the military is stretched and hungry for resources . If you are going to reduce military spending , then change your strategy While it is common for policymakers to advocate spending less on defense , it rarely results in a president asking the military to do less . In fact , the opposite is usually true : the military will be asked to do more with less . Whether it was defeating Al Qaeda and ISIS , deterring Iran and Russia , operations in Libya , or pivoting to Asia , the years of budget - cutting did not see a reduction in military operations . Instead , they led to an overtaxed force with degraded equipment unable to meet the demands of the commander in chief . It is , of course , understandable that a president would prefer not to change his strategy based on fiscal considerations . After all , our enemies and adversaries don ’ t take a knee while the URLTOKEN pauses investing in its military . The lesson here is the enemy has a vote . During the years of budget caps and sequestration , our adversaries – including China and Russia – exploited the opening with remarkable speed . As URLTOKEN military deterrence degraded , we found ourselves confronting near - peer competitors capable of beating us in a fight . President Trump ’ s national security strategy , with its emphasis on great power competition – particularly with China – was clear - eyed about these developments . It employed a strategy aimed at arresting these trends . Failing to adequately resource the military would abandon that strategy and undermine the most significant national security contribution of President Trump ’ s first term . Which leads to a final lesson from our last attempt to reign in federal spending on the backs of the military : Only the commander in chief can protect the military from death by a thousand budget cuts The president has the ability to continue rebuilding our national defense infrastructure and keeping the American people safe by requesting military budgets that sustain his strategy and by making clear in word and deed ( via the veto pen ) that he will not tolerate congressional mischief . CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Failure to take these actions will give tacit approval to Congress to take the military ’ s money and run . Unfortunately , early indicators suggest President Trump may allow just that . If the commander in chief can ’ t find his voice and pen , history may end up repeating itself .

0,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,assumption,"( Bloomberg Opinion ) - - Both the Federal Reserve and the White House are considering emergency measures to combat the economic fallout from the coronavirus . These are the right responses , but they don ’ t go far enough . To be clear , the coronavirus is first and foremost a public - health threat . The full resources of the federal government should be marshaled against it . At the same time , the government shouldn ’ t focus only on public health , and it ’ s wrong to argue that efforts to address the economic effects of the virus are a distraction . The underlying theory seems to be that there are only two possible outcomes of the coronavirus outbreak . Either the URLTOKEN will adequately address the public health threat , in which case emergency economic measures will not be needed ; or the URLTOKEN will fail to prevent a pandemic , in which case they will be useless . This thinking is mistaken . Yes , if there is a pandemic , the human toll will exceed the economic toll — but the economic toll can not be ignored . The URLTOKEN would be facing a severe recession , and efforts to mitigate it could help reduce the number of families faced with the double crisis of illness and unemployment . The very responses necessary to stem the crisis — quarantines , shutting down workplaces , avoiding crowds , and the like — will take a toll on the economy . There is also the possibility that , even if a pandemic is avoided , pockets of the virus will continue to emerge until an effective vaccine can be developed . That scenario would create a constant level of fear that is itself depressing to economic growth . Another drag on growth would be the disruption to global trade as the coronavirus spreads to less prepared nations . All these effects could be enough to push the URLTOKEN into a recession . And once a recession hits , the Fed lacks the tools to easily pull the URLTOKEN out . The prudent course , then , is to take action now . In 2007 , as the global financial crisis was unfolding , the Fed repeatedly relied on half measures until it became clear that the financial sector would fall apart . And the White House ’ s response to the recession was a stimulus that was both inadequate and larded with political favors . Those mistakes should not be repeated . The Fed should immediately cut interest rates by half a percentage point . It should then prepare both to cut interest rates all the way to zero at its March meeting and to outline the extraordinary measures , such as quantitative easing and yield - curve control , that it is prepared to employ if the crises worsens . The White House should send an economic aid package to Congress that includes not only the type of payroll and investment tax relief that Republicans support , but also the social spending and state aid that Democrats support . Including spending provisions would serve two functions . One , it would make the package larger and its impact stronger . Two , it would prevent the package from getting bogged down in partisanship . It would thus avoid a crucial defect of former President Barack Obama ’ s stimulus , which sparked a conservative backlash by failing to include the type of tax cuts that could have earned it Republican support . It ’ s possible that these measures would be overkill . Even if so , the downside is small . At worst , aggressive aid would overstimulate the economy and produce a little inflation . But inflation has been below target for a decade . A tax cut and spending package would also add to the deficit . But it would create far less debt than a prolonged recession . The public health response to the coronavirus has to be the government ’ s top priority . Yet an economic response is also necessary . To be effective , it must be swift , sizable and bipartisan .

0,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,assumption,"( Bloomberg Opinion ) - - Both the Federal Reserve and the White House are considering emergency measures to combat the economic fallout from the coronavirus . These are the right responses , but they don ’ t go far enough . To be clear , the coronavirus is first and foremost a public - health threat . The full resources of the federal government should be marshaled against it . At the same time , the government shouldn ’ t focus only on public health , and it ’ s wrong to argue that efforts to address the economic effects of the virus are a distraction . The underlying theory seems to be that there are only two possible outcomes of the coronavirus outbreak . Either the URLTOKEN will adequately address the public health threat , in which case emergency economic measures will not be needed ; or the URLTOKEN will fail to prevent a pandemic , in which case they will be useless . This thinking is mistaken . Yes , if there is a pandemic , the human toll will exceed the economic toll — but the economic toll can not be ignored . The URLTOKEN would be facing a severe recession , and efforts to mitigate it could help reduce the number of families faced with the double crisis of illness and unemployment . The very responses necessary to stem the crisis — quarantines , shutting down workplaces , avoiding crowds , and the like — will take a toll on the economy . There is also the possibility that , even if a pandemic is avoided , pockets of the virus will continue to emerge until an effective vaccine can be developed . That scenario would create a constant level of fear that is itself depressing to economic growth . Another drag on growth would be the disruption to global trade as the coronavirus spreads to less prepared nations . All these effects could be enough to push the URLTOKEN into a recession . And once a recession hits , the Fed lacks the tools to easily pull the URLTOKEN out . The prudent course , then , is to take action now . In 2007 , as the global financial crisis was unfolding , the Fed repeatedly relied on half measures until it became clear that the financial sector would fall apart . And the White House ’ s response to the recession was a stimulus that was both inadequate and larded with political favors . Those mistakes should not be repeated . The Fed should immediately cut interest rates by half a percentage point . It should then prepare both to cut interest rates all the way to zero at its March meeting and to outline the extraordinary measures , such as quantitative easing and yield - curve control , that it is prepared to employ if the crises worsens . The White House should send an economic aid package to Congress that includes not only the type of payroll and investment tax relief that Republicans support , but also the social spending and state aid that Democrats support .

0,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,assumption,"The coronavirus pandemic has wrecked the economies of US states . Already there is substantial discourse surrounding the need for the federal government to coordinate “ bailouts ” . Indeed , automatic stabilisers such as federal unemployment payments have already kicked in , with some 26 million new applications for unemployment benefits . In the short - term , states such as New York which have been most adversely affected by this virus will require the most assistance . However , in the mid to long - term , as the whole US economy settles into a sort of induced hibernation , all states are likely to require help . It has long been the case that blue states have subsidized the state budgets of red states , whatever Mitch McConnell says . This presents a challenge to the traditional Republican claim to be the party of fiscal responsibility , with the low income tax rates offered by Republican lawmakers being paid for by the financial prudence of Democratic politicians . The tax structure of blue and red states will exacerbate this issue as lockdowns continue . Of the ‘ Big Four ’ ( California , Florida , New York and Texas ) , the two red states are likely to see their state finances thrown into the greatest turmoil . This is because Texas and Florida make up their state budgets with sales taxes ( and no one is buying anything ) while California and New York rely on taxes on incomes ( which will decline during coronavirus , but will not drop off altogether since most high earners are able to work from home ) . A few financially reckless states turning to their more thrifty peers for a bailout is somewhat reminiscent of the Eurozone crisis of the early 2010s . The major difference is that while southern European states ran up large and unsustainable debts in order to finance public spending , Republican states have used federal aid to allow for low tax rates without taking too large a cut out of public services . However , while states can ’ t really go into debt ( meaning they can ’ t declare bankruptcy , again in spite of McConnell ’ s current proposal ) , the response to the shortcomings of Republican state legislators and governors will mirror the aid given to southern European states during the Eurozone crisis . The real difference will likely be in how bailouts are portrayed in the US . While southern European economies have endured unfavorable comparisons to more financially stable northern European countries , Republicans have long falsely claimed that it is in fact red states which fund the financial recklessness of blue states . For a long time , this narrative was left unchallenged ; however , in the current situations , Democrats and in particular Gov . Andrew Cuomo have publicly hit back whenever it ’ s been wheeled out to appease ( or rile up ) Republican voters . There ’ s a chance people will start to see beyond the spin and that the narrative may soon completely collapse . If Democrats are going to start claiming the role of the fiscally responsible party , there are a number of lessons they might learn from the Eurozone crisis . For one , the bailouts given to southern European states came with the condition that countries receiving aid would have to get their finances in order , mainly by cutting government spending . If Democrats demand that red states get their houses in order ( which does seem reasonable ) , it is likely that Republican legislators will cut public services rather than impose income taxes . Such cuts to state spending would place the burden of financial stability on the shoulders of the poorest , while state legislators would be safe in the knowledge that they could blame Congress for such cuts . The main lesson Democrats should learn from the Eurozone crisis , though , is not from the bailouts for southern European states but from the response to the austerity measures that went with them . In the later half of the 2010s , resentment in many European countries gave way to outright rejection of the European Union project . These frustrations have gradually led to a lessening of the fiscal restraints pushed for by Germany and other northern European countries . The coronavirus pandemic seems to have completely undone them . While it may be fiscally prudent for Democrats in Washington to tie bailouts to demands for financial reforms , this will likely lead only to short - lived reforms as red state politicians inevitably lead a backlash against such measures . Read our full mailing list consent terms here Instead , Democrats should seek to change the narrative surrounding state finances . Democrats need to more forcefully show that the tax structures of blue states lead to greater stability than the system favoured in red states . They should also use this as an opportunity to show that a system which favors public services funded by income taxes is not only possible but practical — especially in unforeseen situations and emergencies .",B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption

0,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,assumption,"© Alex Brandon / AP President Donald Trump speaks with reporters before departing on Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House , Tuesday , June 23 , 2020 , in Washington . For many , the Covid - 19 pandemic has exposed the weakness of our federal government . The question is what could be done about it , and how it could be done in a way that strengthens democracy instead of undermining it . There are several paths that we could take in response to this crisis , and only one of them is desirable - - strengthening the federal government by first making investments to reduce distrust among the citizenry . The United States has a form of government where a great deal of power rests with state and local authorities , even when compared to many other contemporary democracies such as France or the United Kingdom . That ' s a product of the way our country was first settled by Europeans , often in in small communities amidst a vast wilderness where strong central control , either from England or from capitals of the colonies , simply was n ' t feasible . This helped pave the way not only for an American tradition of rugged individualism but also for an early form of democracy - - for free White males - - based on local control with a weak center . There was nothing unique or miraculous about the pattern of early democracy in America . Prior to European conquest , Native American societies in the woodlands of eastern North America had organized themselves along exactly the same lines , and the same had been true for many other societies throughout history , from ancient Mesopotamia to pre - colonial Africa . The lesson in all of these societies was simple : Place power in small communities and minimize central control to avoid autocracy . In my new book , I show just how widespread this phenomenon of early democracy was . Now , the big challenge for all democracies with such decentralized institutions is that sometimes central coordination and control is actually helpful , say to provide for external defense , or to facilitate economic development , or maybe even in the face of a pandemic to make sure that nurses do n ' t have to wear garbage bags in place of standard protective equipment . It can actually be a good thing to have an effective central state . In the United States today we are in the process of learning how 40 years of an ideology bent on undercutting our government ` ` in Washington ' ' has eroded central power just when we could have most used it to provide a coordinated response to Covid - 19 . So , what does this mean for the future of our democracy ? The potential risk with increased central control has always been that it will give way to the decline of democracy and the rise of autocracy . Throughout history , emergencies involving famine , pestilence and war have given a window to would - be autocrats to assert themselves , build strong central state institutions , and dispense with any need for consulting the people . Today , from Hungary to Cambodia , autocrats are hoping the current pandemic produces precisely this same outcome . To consider what history says about this possibility , take the case of Prussia . Prior to the Thirty Years ' War ( 1618 - 1648 ) , which spread violence , famine , and pestilence , governance in Prussia had resembled that in many other areas of Western Europe . There were representative assemblies that checked the power of rulers , and towns had a degree of autonomy . This was not democracy as we would think of it today , but it was a far cry from the type of centralized autocracy one would have seen in China at the time under the Ming dynasty . The crisis of the Thirty Years ' War gave an opening for Prussia ' s rulers , the Hohenzollerns , to construct a new form of centralized , bureaucratic state that would dispense with any need for consultation of the people or their representatives . This new state proved effective in many ways , but it also set the country on an autocratic trajectory that would not truly be ended until the official abolition of the State of Prussia by the Allied Control Council on February 25 , 1947 , in the wake of Germany ' s defeat in World War II . It was a model that deprived people of their freedom in what German historian Otto Hintze referred to as a ` ` police state . ' ' Does Prussian experience suggest what could happen in the United States if we strengthened our central state institutions ? Probably not . The most obvious reason for this is that Covid at its worst will be much less destructive than the Thirty Years ' War , but there is also a deeper factor pushing in the same direction . Democratic practices in the United States emerged long before a central state first developed , and at each moment of state strengthening , from the Constitution to the New Deal , representatives of the people have played a fundamental role in shaping the new state institutions rather than having them be imposed in top - down fashion . We can hope that this pattern continues . So , could we see a second , positive path for the United States where democracy is preserved and central state institutions are strengthened in response to better deal with the next pandemic ? Perhaps . But there ' s also a risk of a third , less positive trajectory : Our democracy will survive , but it will also keep failing to do what we want . To see this , take a look at the evidence on which parts of our government are trusted today . We know that in the current crisis , many state governors like Andrew Cuomo are getting better marks for their efforts than is Donald Trump as President . While much of this has to do with the individual personalities involved , this phenomenon also has deeper roots , and it tells us much about the challenge facing American democracy today . It has actually been decades now - - through presidential administrations of both parties - - that there has been substantially lower trust in the federal government compared to state and local governments . The evidence on trust at different levels of government suggests that we in the United States have not escaped a fundamental constraint ; across the broad sweep of human history , democratic governance has been most successful as a small - scale affair . Contrary to what James Madison told us in Federalist 10 , the US Constitution did not solve the problem of maintaining democracy over such a large territory . The big problem for large republics is to avoid having their citizens become distrustful of a distant center , a phenomenon that goes hand in hand with polarization . Thinkers in the early republic soon recognized their predicament , as did Madison himself after the founding . Members of Congress set about trying to address this threat through investments such as the subsidized distribution of newspapers - - so that people would have better information - - and state governments began to provide funding for common schools where people could be educated to participate in democratic governance . The lesson from the early republic is clear : Large scale is a challenge for a democracy , but this obstacle can be overcome . If we are to hope to strengthen our institutions to deal with the next pandemic , or the next emergency , then we need to first think about how we can invest anew in connecting citizens to government . One idea here is to draw directly on early 19th - century experience and invest anew in civic education , a subject that has been given short shrift of late . If we do this then we will have to also recognize that as was the case two centuries ago , this will not happen on its own . It is the government itself that will need to make the effort .",B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote

1,Authoritie's Actions,Authorities' Response to COVID,statistics,"Fargo , North Dakota , is the fifth - best place to move to after the coronavirus pandemic . Shutterstock Some people might be considering moving to a new part of the US after the coronavirus pandemic . We used nine metrics for 380 US metro areas to calculate an overall score that we used to find the best cities to move to after the pandemic . Some of the 30 best cities to move to are in Illinois , Iowa , and Wyoming . Visit Business Insider ' s homepage for more stories . The pandemic has brought on new changes for many Americans , including working from home for the first time or having to temporarily relocate . If you are considering permanently moving to a new place after the novel coronavirus pandemic , you may want to consider one of these 30 US cities . Recent polling has suggested that many Americans are thinking about moving . The news website Axios reported in late April on a Harris Poll survey that found that about one - third of Americans said they were thinking about moving to less densely populated places . And research from Moody ' s Analytics found that less densely populated places with a larger share of jobs requiring a bachelor ' s degree or higher are likely to recover first from the economic impact of the pandemic . During stay - at - home orders to slow the spread of the virus , more and more Americans have transitioned to working from their homes .

Each measure was rescaled to a uniform z - score , allowing us to add the values together to get a final overall index for each metro area that we then used to rank the 30 metro areas at the top of the list .

1,Authoritie's Actions,Authorities' Response to COVID,statistics,"© AP In this combination of file photos , former Vice President Joe Biden speaks in Wilmington , Del . , on March 12 , 2020 , left , and President Donald Trump speaks at the White House in Washington on April 5 , 2020 . Public preference for Joe Biden over Donald Trump in trust to handle the coronavirus pandemic has soared since March in the latest ABC News / Washington Post poll , boosting Biden – along with other measures – in the race for the White House . Three and a half months ago the two candidates were virtually even in trust to handle the pandemic , Trump + 2 percentage points , 45 - 43 % . Today , with COVID - 19 cases surging around the nation , Biden leads Trump on the issue by a 20 - point margin , 54 - 34 % . See PDF for full results , charts , and tables . Biden ’ s also advanced , nearly to par with Trump , in trust to handle the economy , after trailing in March . Biden leads Trump by 9 points on handling crime and safety , a focal point of Trump ’ s in recent weeks . And on race relations , Biden leads by his largest margin , 25 points , 58 - 33 % . Biden has his own risks , particularly a pronounced lack of enthusiasm for his candidacy . Yet the impact of that deficit remains to be seen : For two - thirds of his supporters , it ’ s chiefly not about electing Biden , but about defeating Trump . The president , moreover , has other challenges , ranging from performance assessments to personal attributes . As reported Friday , approval of his handling of the pandemic has fallen from 51 % in late March to 38 % now , with disapproval up 15 points . He ’ s lost 7 points in approval of his handling of the economy , to 50 % , with disapproval up 9 . Trump ’ s overall job approval rating is 39 % in this poll , produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates – down 9 points in the course of the pandemic , with disapproval up 11 . Trump remains the first president in modern polling never to achieve majority approval for his work in office , with the lowest career average on record . Rising disapproval of Trump ’ s job performance is broadly based . It ’ s up 22 points since March among those very worried about catching the coronavirus , to 82 % . It ’ s also up in two of his key support groups , + 20 points among rural Americans and + 12 points among evangelical white Protestants , to 45 and 30 % , respectively . Disapproval also is up especially among Southerners ( + 18 points ) ; and Blacks , women , moderates and suburbanites , all up 15 to 16 . By partisanship , Democrats now disapprove nearly unanimously of Trump ’ s work in office , up 17 points in three and a half months to 95 % ; 56 % of independents also disapprove , up 11 . Among Republicans , 16 % disapprove , up 10 points from late May . Beyond job approval , Biden leads Trump by 26 points in being seen as having the better personality and temperament to serve as president . In a related finding , a vast 76 % of Americans say Trump , in talking about people he disagrees with , “ crosses the line in terms of what ’ s acceptable . ” Fifty points fewer , 26 % , say Biden does the same . Sixty - one percent say Trump has done more to divide than to unite the country , more than said so about either of his two predecessors in office . When asked which candidates would do more to unite Americans , Biden leads by another wide margin , 57 - 33 % . Biden leads by double digits on other personal attributes as well – better understanding the problems of people like you ( + 17 points ) , being more honest and trustworthy ( + 14 ) , better representing your personal values ( + 12 ) and having a better idea of what America should stand for ( + 10 ) . Trump pushes to parity on just one , who ’ s the stronger leader , an even 45 - 45 % split . While views are similar among registered voters , Biden loses ground on three of these items among those who are likeliest to vote . In the largest difference , he goes from a 26 - point lead among all adults in having the personality and temperament needed to serve as president to a slight 11 - point edge among likely voters , 53 - 42 % . He also slips among likely voters in who better understands their problems and who ’ s the stronger leader . These gaps in views of the candidates inform their current standings : Americans divide 54 - 39 % in Biden ’ s favor if the election were today . Among registered voters , the margin ’ s the same , 55 - 40 % . Among likely voters Biden still leads , albeit by a closer 10 points , 54 - 44 % , signaling the customary GOP advantage in turnout – potentially one of Trump ’ s strongest weapons . Biden ’ s advantage among registered voters is up from a virtual dead heat , 49 - 47 % , in late March , before the spiraling pandemic situation hammered Trump ’ s ratings . Biden , similarly , was just + 4 among registered voters in January , as economic sentiment hit a 20 - year high . That said , what comes can go : Biden led Trump by 17 points last October and 15 in September , leads that he then relinquished , only to fully regain his footing now . Trump ' s retreat since the early days of the coronavirus outbreak has been largest in one of his core groups , rural Americans , with his lead among registered voters in this group shrinking from 47 points in late March to 18 points now , 56 - 38 % . As noted Friday , his rating for handling the pandemic also has fallen especially sharply in rural areas . ( The race is 52 - 43 % , Biden - Trump , among suburbanites , and 68 - 27 % in urban areas , both essentially steady . ) Regional shifts also are substantial . Biden ' s advanced in the Midwest , from a dead heat to a 17 - point lead . It ’ s close in the South , 50 - 44 % , Biden - Trump , compared with a 13 - point Trump lead in late March . And Biden is ahead by 15 points in the Northeast and a broad 30 points in the West . In a key center group , Biden leads by 54 - 37 % among independents , unchanged from May but up from an even split in March . Biden now leads by 25 points among women , double his margin in late March , and is a non - significant + 4 among men , compared with - 9 among men then . This includes a broad 60 - 36 % Biden lead among suburban women , compared with a virtual dead heat among suburban men , 49 - 45 % , Trump - Biden . Biden holds a 30 - point lead among college graduates , 63 - 33 % , vs . + 15 points in late March . ( Hillary Clinton won this group by just 10 points in 2016 , 52 - 42 % . ) And Trump has gone from an 18 - point lead among white registered voters to a scant 4 points now , while 94 % of Black registered voters support Biden . White Catholics , potentially a swing voter group , divide essentially evenly , 51 - 47 % , Trump - Biden , vs . + 13 for Trump in March ; Trump won white Catholics by 61 - 37 % in 2016 . Trump currently does better , 61 - 34 % , among non - college white men , but this is a group he won with 71 % four years ago . Across the political spectrum , college - educated white women favor Biden by 60 - 38 % , compared with their 51 - 44 % vote for Clinton over Trump in 2016 . Trump retains support from 90 % of registered voters who say they voted for him in 2016 , but loses 8 % of them to Biden . Biden , for his part , wins 95 % of Clinton ’ s 2016 supporters , with 3 % going to Trump . Notably , too , Biden wins registered voters who are very worried about catching the coronavirus by an overwhelming 82 - 14 % , and those who are somewhat worried by a narrower 53 - 41 % . Those who are less worried , by contrast , prefer Trump , 69 - 26 % . Indeed , in a statistical analysis called regression , being worried about catching the coronavirus is a significant independent predictor of vote preference , controlling for other factors including partisanship , ideology and demographics . Eighty - six percent of registered voters say they ’ re certain to cast a ballot in the November election , somewhat higher than typical at this point in recent cycles – it was 79 to 81 % in July 2016 , 2012 and 2008 alike . In what manner they ’ ll vote is another question . Thirty - eight percent of Americans say they ’ d prefer to vote by mail , 59 % in person . In 2016 , for context , 24 % voted by mail , according to the URLTOKEN Election Assistance Commission . It ’ s a key point of interest given efforts by some states to encourage mail - in voting as a way to avoid virus infection at in - person polling places . If mail balloting does surge , counting those ballots could delay the vote count beyond election night . Trump has pushed back against mail - in voting , alleging that it ’ s open to fraud , and the argument has some resonance : Forty - nine percent see voting by mail as vulnerable to significant levels of fraud , while 43 % think adequate protections against significant fraud are in place . Partisanship divides these views . Among Biden supporters , just 28 % see mail - in voting as vulnerable to substantial fraud , and 54 % say it ’ s how they prefer to vote . Among Trump supporters , by contrast , 78 % see mail - in voting as vulnerable , and only 17 % prefer to vote that way . Among people who prefer to vote by mail , 23 % see it as vulnerable to significant fraud . This soars to 67 % of those who prefer to vote in person . Other factors come into play . Preference to vote by mail is much higher in the West , 56 % , likely reflecting its prevalence there , vs . as low as 25 % in the Northeast . It ’ s also much higher among college graduates than non - graduates . From how people vote to whom they vote for , the course of the pandemic is a clear wildcard in the November election . So , as noted , is the question of enthusiasm . Among registered voters who support Trump , 69 % are very enthusiastic about doing so , much better than it was for him in 2016 . That compares with 39 % enthusiasm for Biden among his supporters . To the extent that enthusiasm translates to turnout , this could put Biden ’ s current lead in jeopardy . Then again , motivation for Biden may come from another direction . Among Trump ’ s supporters , 72 % say it ’ s more important to them to re - elect Trump than to defeat Biden . Among Biden ’ s supporters , it ’ s almost the opposite : Sixty - seven percent say their main interest is to defeat Trump .

1,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,statistics,"© Getty Images Support slides for Republican governors ' handling of COVID - 19 , holds steady for Democrats Support for Republican governors ' handling of the coronavirus pandemic declined throughout June , while support for their Democratic counterparts remained steady , according to a Gallup poll released Tuesday . Forty - three percent of those surveyed in Republican - led states said their governor communicated a ` ` clear plan of action , ' ' based on the new poll . That is an 11 - point drop from the 54 percent of surveyed Americans living in one of 26 states led by a Republican governor who said the same in early June . Similarly , just 53 percent of surveyed Americans in those states now say their governor cares about the safety and health of the community , marking an 8 - point decline from the 61 percent who said the same early last month . Ratings for Democratic governors ' handling of the pandemic did not have the same dips from the start of June , according to the poll . Sixty - five percent of Americans in one of the 24 states led by a Democratic governor said in the new poll that their governor communicated a clear plan of action , compared to 66 percent at the start of June . Fifty - eight percent now say their Democratic governor cares about the safety and health of the community , as did 57 percent at the start of June , according to Gallup . The drop for Republican governors is largely led by decreased support among independents , Gallup noted . The majority of independents in Republican - led states said their governors communicated a clear plan of action in response to the pandemic and cared about the safety and health of the community at the start of June . But in the latest survey , just 39 percent of independents in those states said their governor communicated a clear plan of action and just 47 percent said their governor cares about the safety and health of the community . The Gallup poll is based on self - administered web surveys conducted June 29 to July 5 with a sample of 3 , 609 adults who are members of the Gallup panel . There is a margin of error of 3 percentage points .",O I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption

1,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,statistics,"states where residents are financially hurting the most during covid19 Despite various government relief programs , the coronavirus crisis has already affected the finances of many Americans . Over the past eight weeks , more than one in four individuals filed for unemployment . Though unemployment benefits are expanded under the CARES Act , enhanced benefits are scheduled to end on July 31 , 2020 . Additionally , though many businesses say they will rehire workers as the virus becomes contained , University of Chicago economists have theorized that more than 40 % of recent layoffs will result in permanent job loss . Beyond unemployed workers , Americans who are still working may face financial pressure as well . According to a National Endowment for Financial Education ( NEFE ) April 2020 survey , nearly nine in 10 Americans say the COVID - 19 crisis is causing stress on their personal finances . Like the spread of the virus , financial shocks have been felt more in some places than others . In this study , SmartAsset looked at the states where residents have been financially hurting the most during COVID - 19 . We compared the 50 URLTOKEN states across six metrics . They include recent measures of unemployment along with measures of housing and food insecurity . For details on our data sources and how we put all the information together to create our final rankings , check out the Data and Methodology section below . Residents in populous states may be experiencing the largest financial fallout . California , Texas , Florida and New York are the most populous states in the URLTOKEN Those four states all rank within the top 10 states where residents are financially hurting the most due to the coronavirus pandemic , according to our findings . More specifically , they all fall within the 15 states in the study with the highest recent housing insecurity , and within the 25 states in the study with the most recent food insufficiency . Housing insecurity varies widely across states . The Census Bureau ’ s new Household Pulse Survey asks respondents if they missed last month ’ s rent or mortgage payment or if they were not confident that their household can pay next month ’ s rent or mortgage on time . In Iowa , fewer than 15 % of residents expressed concern about making housing payments during mid - May . By contrast , close to one in two Mississippi residents replied that they either missed last month ’ s payment or expected to be unable to pay the coming month ’ s bill . Residents in Louisiana have been hit hard financially during the coronavirus pandemic . With the third - highest poverty rate in the nation , close to 16 % of adults in Louisiana recently did not have enough food over the course of a week . Additionally , Louisiana had the 12th - highest percentage of residents , at approximately 29 % , report that they either missed last month ’ s rent or mortgage payment or were not confident that they could make next month ’ s payment on time . Many Michigan residents have been laid off in recent weeks . Michigan ’ s unemployment rate increased the third - most of any state during COVID - 19 ; its April 2020 unemployment rate marks a URLTOKEN percentage point increase from February 2020 . Unemployed persons in Michigan receive less in jobless compensation relative to those in other states . The unemployment replacement rate in the state under the CARES Act , or the ratio of average unemployment benefits received to the average worker ’ s salary , in Michigan is the 11th - lowest of all 50 states . According to data published by the University of Chicago , the average pre - COVID weekly unemployment benefit was $ 362 . With the additional $ 600 per week , the pandemic unemployment replacement rate is 133 % . Unemployment and food insufficiency in Ohio have been high in recent months according to BLS and Census data . The unemployment rate in April 2020 was URLTOKEN , the sixth - highest of all 50 states . Moreover , in mid - May , URLTOKEN of residents reported that they either sometimes or often did not have enough to eat during the previous seven days . This is the fifth - highest rate of residents reporting food insufficiency . In 2018 , URLTOKEN Mississippi residents fell below the poverty line , the highest percentage of residents for this metric in any state . The coronavirus pandemic seems to have exacerbated some common measures of poverty within the state . According to Census Bureau survey data collected in mid - May , more than 46 % of adults reported that they either missed last month ’ s rent or mortgage payment or have slight or no confidence that their household can pay next month ’ s rent or mortgage on time . Moreover , close 18 % of adults said that within the last week they either sometimes or often did not have enough to eat . Historically , a high percentage of residents across many Florida cities have been housing - cost burdened . Housing burdens in Florida may be exacerbated due to COVID - 19 . According to Census Bureau data from the Household Pulse Survey , more than 32 % of adults recently reported that they are facing housing insecurity , the second - highest rate of across all 50 states . Florida residents also reported the fourth - highest rate of food insufficiency during the same survey week . Though an individual filing for unemployment in New York could receive a weekly benefit of up to $ 504 , the average benefit is $ 417 . With the average worker earning about $ 800 per week , the pandemic unemployment replacement rate ( with the additional $ 600 ) is 127 % , the seventh - lowest in our study . More than one in eight New Yorkers may be currently filing for unemployment . April 2020 BLS data shows that URLTOKEN of New York ’ s labor force is unemployed . This marks a URLTOKEN percentage point increase from pre - COVID levels . Unemployment in Illinois rose sharply between February 2020 and April 2020 , increasing by URLTOKEN percentage points , the eighth - largest jump in our study . With that rise , Illinois ’ April 2020 unemployment rate was URLTOKEN , URLTOKEN points higher than the national average and the seventh - highest of all 50 states . Despite low historic poverty rates , recent survey data compiled on residents in Illinois shows a different picture . More than one in four adults recently reported housing insecurity , while about one in eight were experiencing food insufficiencies . In 2018 , Tennessee had the ninth - highest poverty rate of all 50 states , with URLTOKEN of residents falling below the federal poverty line . Economic changes due to coronavirus may exacerbate poverty within the state . Over the past two months , Tennessee saw the 14th - largest increase in unemployment , and its most recent unemployment rate from April 2020 ( URLTOKEN is the 18th - highest in the nation . Recent survey data from the Census shows that close to 25 % of Tennessee residents are housing insecure , while more than 11 % are food insufficient . Though the April 2020 unemployment rate in Texas was about two percentage points lower than the national rate , a high percentage of Texan residents have reported recent financial stress . In mid - May , more than 30 % of residents said that they either missed last month ’ s housing payment or did not have confidence they would be able to make the coming month ’ s payment . Additionally , close to 13 % of adult survey respondents said they did not always have enough to eat during the previous week . Relative to other states , that is the seventh - highest rate of housing insecurity and sixth - highest rate of food insufficiency . California had the 10th - highest April 2020 unemployment rate of any state , at URLTOKEN Beyond this , the unemployment replacement rate under the CARES Act in California is lower than in 10 other states . The average California worker earns $ 723 each week . Though the maximum weekly unemployment benefits in California is $ 450 , the average weekly benefit is $ 361 . Thus , the typical replacement rate is 50 % while the pandemic unemployment replacement rate , with the additional $ 600 federal benefit , is 133 % . To find the states where residents are financially hurting the most during COVID - 19 , SmartAsset looked at data for all 50 URLTOKEN states . We compared them across six metrics : April 2020 unemployment rate . Data comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics ’ Local Area Unemployment Statistics . Increase in unemployment during COVID - 19 . This is the percentage point difference between the February 2020 unemployment rate and April 2020 unemployment rate . Data comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics ’ Local Area Unemployment Statistics . Unemployment replacement rate under the CARES Act . This is the ratio of average unemployment benefit received to the average worker ’ s weekly salary . The average unemployment benefit includes the additional $ 600 weekly benefit under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance ( PUA ) Program as part of the CARES Act . Data comes from the University of Chicago ’ s Unemployment Insurance Calculator . Percentage of adults experiencing recent housing insecurity . This is the percentage of adults who missed last month ’ s rent or mortgage payment , or who have slight or no confidence that their household can pay next month ’ s rent or mortgage on time . Data comes from the Census Bureau ’ s Household Pulse Survey . Respondents were surveyed from May 14 , 2020 through May 19 , 2020 . Percentage of adults experiencing recent food insufficiency . This is the percentage of adults in households where there was either sometimes or often not enough to eat in the last seven days . Data comes from the Census Bureau ’ s Household Pulse Survey . Respondents were surveyed from May 14 , 2020 through May 19 , 2020 . Poverty rate . This is the percentage of residents living below the poverty line . Data comes from the URLTOKEN Census Bureau ’ s 1 - year American Community Survey . We ranked each state in every metric , giving a half weight to the first two metrics : April 2020 unemployment rate and increase in unemployment during COVID - 19 . We gave a full weight to all other metrics . Using those rankings , we found each state ’ s average ranking and used the average to determine a final score . The state with the highest average ranking received a score of 100 . The state with the lowest average ranking received a score of 0 .

1,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,statistics,"President Trump announced Monday he would temporarily suspend immigration as the coronavirus crisis continues . The public appears to agree this is a prudent idea . A poll conducted three days ago found that seven out of 10 voters support this measure . “ Seventy percent of registered voters believe the federal government should place a temporary ban on allowing people from any other country to enter the United States , ” reported a Scott Rasmussen national survey conducted late last week . “ That total includes 34 % who believe that even Americans living abroad should have to wait until the pandemic is over before returning , ” the poll analysis said . The temporary ban is supported by 82 % of Republicans , 66 % of Independents , and 64 % of Democrats — as well as 79 % of conservatives , 71 % of independents and 58 % of liberals . A majority of those who are not fans of the president also agree . “ Among those who strongly approve of President Trump , 84 % support the ban . Among those who strongly disapprove of the president , 57 % share that same view , ” the poll said . “ Overall , among all voters , just 15 % oppose a temporary ban . In no measured demographic group does opposition reach 25 % . ” Copyright © 2021 The Washington Times , LLC .

0,Authoritie's Actions,Authorities' Response to COVID,statistics,"Fargo , North Dakota , is the fifth - best place to move to after the coronavirus pandemic . Shutterstock Some people might be considering moving to a new part of the US after the coronavirus pandemic . We used nine metrics for 380 US metro areas to calculate an overall score that we used to find the best cities to move to after the pandemic . Some of the 30 best cities to move to are in Illinois , Iowa , and Wyoming . Visit Business Insider ' s homepage for more stories . The pandemic has brought on new changes for many Americans , including working from home for the first time or having to temporarily relocate . If you are considering permanently moving to a new place after the novel coronavirus pandemic , you may want to consider one of these 30 US cities . Recent polling has suggested that many Americans are thinking about moving . The news website Axios reported in late April on a Harris Poll survey that found that about one - third of Americans said they were thinking about moving to less densely populated places . And research from Moody ' s Analytics found that less densely populated places with a larger share of jobs requiring a bachelor ' s degree or higher are likely to recover first from the economic impact of the pandemic . During stay - at - home orders to slow the spread of the virus , more and more Americans have transitioned to working from their homes . In a Gallup analysis , 62 % of respondents in a survey conducted from March 30 to April 2 said they were working from home , compared with 31 % of respondents in a survey conducted from March 13 to 15 . Gallup polling has indicated that even after stay - at - home orders lift and employees can return to offices , some people are thinking about working remotely at least part of the time . In a survey conducted from April 13 to 19 , 53 % of respondents said they would work remotely as much as they could , while 47 % said they would return to the office as much as they previously did . Some companies have extended remote work into the next year , such as American Express . Additionally , polling from Pew Research Center found 22 % of US adults moved or knew someone who moved during the pandemic . The moving resource site HireAHelper found there have been more people moving in than out in states like Idaho and New Mexico since March . Based on moving surveys and an uptick in telework , Business Insider decided to find out which cities could be the best to live in after the coronavirus pandemic for those Americans seeking a new home and planning to continue remote work .

To find the best cities , we used nine economic , educational , and demographic metrics from government data sources and academic research that we think people might consider when moving and that could help a metro area recover faster from the economic effects of the pandemic . These measures are the most recent unemployment rate , ability to work from home , population density , housing affordability , monthly household costs , cost of living , weekly two - way work commute , total elementary - and secondary - school spending per student , and share of residents age 25 and over who have at least a bachelor ' s degree . Each measure was rescaled to a uniform z - score , allowing us to add the values together to get a final overall index for each metro area that we then used to rank the 30 metro areas at the top of the list .

0,Authoritie's Actions,Authorities' Response to COVID,statistics,"© AP In this combination of file photos , former Vice President Joe Biden speaks in Wilmington , Del . , on March 12 , 2020 , left , and President Donald Trump speaks at the White House in Washington on April 5 , 2020 . Public preference for Joe Biden over Donald Trump in trust to handle the coronavirus pandemic has soared since March in the latest ABC News / Washington Post poll , boosting Biden – along with other measures – in the race for the White House . Three and a half months ago the two candidates were virtually even in trust to handle the pandemic , Trump + 2 percentage points , 45 - 43 % . Today , with COVID - 19 cases surging around the nation , Biden leads Trump on the issue by a 20 - point margin , 54 - 34 % . See PDF for full results , charts , and tables . Biden ’ s also advanced , nearly to par with Trump , in trust to handle the economy , after trailing in March . Biden leads Trump by 9 points on handling crime and safety , a focal point of Trump ’ s in recent weeks . And on race relations , Biden leads by his largest margin , 25 points , 58 - 33 % . Biden has his own risks , particularly a pronounced lack of enthusiasm for his candidacy . Yet the impact of that deficit remains to be seen : For two - thirds of his supporters , it ’ s chiefly not about electing Biden , but about defeating Trump . The president , moreover , has other challenges , ranging from performance assessments to personal attributes . As reported Friday , approval of his handling of the pandemic has fallen from 51 % in late March to 38 % now , with disapproval up 15 points . He ’ s lost 7 points in approval of his handling of the economy , to 50 % , with disapproval up 9 . Trump ’ s overall job approval rating is 39 % in this poll , produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates – down 9 points in the course of the pandemic , with disapproval up 11 . Trump remains the first president in modern polling never to achieve majority approval for his work in office , with the lowest career average on record . Rising disapproval of Trump ’ s job performance is broadly based . It ’ s up 22 points since March among those very worried about catching the coronavirus , to 82 % . It ’ s also up in two of his key support groups , + 20 points among rural Americans and + 12 points among evangelical white Protestants , to 45 and 30 % , respectively . Disapproval also is up especially among Southerners ( + 18 points ) ; and Blacks , women , moderates and suburbanites , all up 15 to 16 . By partisanship , Democrats now disapprove nearly unanimously of Trump ’ s work in office , up 17 points in three and a half months to 95 % ; 56 % of independents also disapprove , up 11 . Among Republicans , 16 % disapprove , up 10 points from late May . Beyond job approval , Biden leads Trump by 26 points in being seen as having the better personality and temperament to serve as president . In a related finding , a vast 76 % of Americans say Trump , in talking about people he disagrees with , “ crosses the line in terms of what ’ s acceptable . ” Fifty points fewer , 26 % , say Biden does the same . Sixty - one percent say Trump has done more to divide than to unite the country , more than said so about either of his two predecessors in office . When asked which candidates would do more to unite Americans , Biden leads by another wide margin , 57 - 33 % . Biden leads by double digits on other personal attributes as well – better understanding the problems of people like you ( + 17 points ) , being more honest and trustworthy ( + 14 ) , better representing your personal values ( + 12 ) and having a better idea of what America should stand for ( + 10 ) . Trump pushes to parity on just one , who ’ s the stronger leader , an even 45 - 45 % split . While views are similar among registered voters , Biden loses ground on three of these items among those who are likeliest to vote . In the largest difference , he goes from a 26 - point lead among all adults in having the personality and temperament needed to serve as president to a slight 11 - point edge among likely voters , 53 - 42 % . He also slips among likely voters in who better understands their problems and who ’ s the stronger leader . These gaps in views of the candidates inform their current standings : Americans divide 54 - 39 % in Biden ’ s favor if the election were today . Among registered voters , the margin ’ s the same , 55 - 40 % . Among likely voters Biden still leads , albeit by a closer 10 points , 54 - 44 % , signaling the customary GOP advantage in turnout – potentially one of Trump ’ s strongest weapons . Biden ’ s advantage among registered voters is up from a virtual dead heat , 49 - 47 % , in late March , before the spiraling pandemic situation hammered Trump ’ s ratings . Biden , similarly , was just + 4 among registered voters in January , as economic sentiment hit a 20 - year high . That said , what comes can go : Biden led Trump by 17 points last October and 15 in September , leads that he then relinquished , only to fully regain his footing now . Trump ' s retreat since the early days of the coronavirus outbreak has been largest in one of his core groups , rural Americans , with his lead among registered voters in this group shrinking from 47 points in late March to 18 points now , 56 - 38 % . As noted Friday , his rating for handling the pandemic also has fallen especially sharply in rural areas . ( The race is 52 - 43 % , Biden - Trump , among suburbanites , and 68 - 27 % in urban areas , both essentially steady . ) Regional shifts also are substantial . Biden ' s advanced in the Midwest , from a dead heat to a 17 - point lead . It ’ s close in the South , 50 - 44 % , Biden - Trump , compared with a 13 - point Trump lead in late March . And Biden is ahead by 15 points in the Northeast and a broad 30 points in the West . In a key center group , Biden leads by 54 - 37 % among independents , unchanged from May but up from an even split in March . Biden now leads by 25 points among women , double his margin in late March , and is a non - significant + 4 among men , compared with - 9 among men then . This includes a broad 60 - 36 % Biden lead among suburban women , compared with a virtual dead heat among suburban men , 49 - 45 % , Trump - Biden . Biden holds a 30 - point lead among college graduates , 63 - 33 % , vs . + 15 points in late March . ( Hillary Clinton won this group by just 10 points in 2016 , 52 - 42 % . ) And Trump has gone from an 18 - point lead among white registered voters to a scant 4 points now , while 94 % of Black registered voters support Biden . White Catholics , potentially a swing voter group , divide essentially evenly , 51 - 47 % , Trump - Biden , vs . + 13 for Trump in March ; Trump won white Catholics by 61 - 37 % in 2016 . Trump currently does better , 61 - 34 % , among non - college white men , but this is a group he won with 71 % four years ago . Across the political spectrum , college - educated white women favor Biden by 60 - 38 % , compared with their 51 - 44 % vote for Clinton over Trump in 2016 . Trump retains support from 90 % of registered voters who say they voted for him in 2016 , but loses 8 % of them to Biden . Biden , for his part , wins 95 % of Clinton ’ s 2016 supporters , with 3 % going to Trump . Notably , too , Biden wins registered voters who are very worried about catching the coronavirus by an overwhelming 82 - 14 % , and those who are somewhat worried by a narrower 53 - 41 % . Those who are less worried , by contrast , prefer Trump , 69 - 26 % . Indeed , in a statistical analysis called regression , being worried about catching the coronavirus is a significant independent predictor of vote preference , controlling for other factors including partisanship , ideology and demographics . Eighty - six percent of registered voters say they ’ re certain to cast a ballot in the November election , somewhat higher than typical at this point in recent cycles – it was 79 to 81 % in July 2016 , 2012 and 2008 alike . In what manner they ’ ll vote is another question . Thirty - eight percent of Americans say they ’ d prefer to vote by mail , 59 % in person . In 2016 , for context , 24 % voted by mail , according to the URLTOKEN Election Assistance Commission . It ’ s a key point of interest given efforts by some states to encourage mail - in voting as a way to avoid virus infection at in - person polling places . If mail balloting does surge , counting those ballots could delay the vote count beyond election night . Trump has pushed back against mail - in voting , alleging that it ’ s open to fraud , and the argument has some resonance : Forty - nine percent see voting by mail as vulnerable to significant levels of fraud , while 43 % think adequate protections against significant fraud are in place . Partisanship divides these views . Among Biden supporters , just 28 % see mail - in voting as vulnerable to substantial fraud , and 54 % say it ’ s how they prefer to vote . Among Trump supporters , by contrast , 78 % see mail - in voting as vulnerable , and only 17 % prefer to vote that way . Among people who prefer to vote by mail , 23 % see it as vulnerable to significant fraud . This soars to 67 % of those who prefer to vote in person . Other factors come into play . Preference to vote by mail is much higher in the West , 56 % , likely reflecting its prevalence there , vs . as low as 25 % in the Northeast . It ’ s also much higher among college graduates than non - graduates . From how people vote to whom they vote for , the course of the pandemic is a clear wildcard in the November election . So , as noted , is the question of enthusiasm . Among registered voters who support Trump , 69 % are very enthusiastic about doing so , much better than it was for him in 2016 . That compares with 39 % enthusiasm for Biden among his supporters . To the extent that enthusiasm translates to turnout , this could put Biden ’ s current lead in jeopardy . Then again , motivation for Biden may come from another direction . Among Trump ’ s supporters , 72 % say it ’ s more important to them to re - elect Trump than to defeat Biden . Among Biden ’ s supporters , it ’ s almost the opposite : Sixty - seven percent say their main interest is to defeat Trump .

0,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,statistics,"© Getty Images Support slides for Republican governors ' handling of COVID - 19 , holds steady for Democrats Support for Republican governors ' handling of the coronavirus pandemic declined throughout June , while support for their Democratic counterparts remained steady , according to a Gallup poll released Tuesday . Forty - three percent of those surveyed in Republican - led states said their governor communicated a ` ` clear plan of action , ' ' based on the new poll . That is an 11 - point drop from the 54 percent of surveyed Americans living in one of 26 states led by a Republican governor who said the same in early June . Similarly , just 53 percent of surveyed Americans in those states now say their governor cares about the safety and health of the community , marking an 8 - point decline from the 61 percent who said the same early last month . Ratings for Democratic governors ' handling of the pandemic did not have the same dips from the start of June , according to the poll . Sixty - five percent of Americans in one of the 24 states led by a Democratic governor said in the new poll that their governor communicated a clear plan of action , compared to 66 percent at the start of June . Fifty - eight percent now say their Democratic governor cares about the safety and health of the community , as did 57 percent at the start of June , according to Gallup . The drop for Republican governors is largely led by decreased support among independents , Gallup noted . The majority of independents in Republican - led states said their governors communicated a clear plan of action in response to the pandemic and cared about the safety and health of the community at the start of June . But in the latest survey , just 39 percent of independents in those states said their governor communicated a clear plan of action and just 47 percent said their governor cares about the safety and health of the community . The Gallup poll is based on self - administered web surveys conducted June 29 to July 5 with a sample of 3 , 609 adults who are members of the Gallup panel . There is a margin of error of 3 percentage points .",O I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption

0,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,statistics,"states where residents are financially hurting the most during covid19 Despite various government relief programs , the coronavirus crisis has already affected the finances of many Americans . Over the past eight weeks , more than one in four individuals filed for unemployment . Though unemployment benefits are expanded under the CARES Act , enhanced benefits are scheduled to end on July 31 , 2020 . Additionally , though many businesses say they will rehire workers as the virus becomes contained , University of Chicago economists have theorized that more than 40 % of recent layoffs will result in permanent job loss . Beyond unemployed workers , Americans who are still working may face financial pressure as well . According to a National Endowment for Financial Education ( NEFE ) April 2020 survey , nearly nine in 10 Americans say the COVID - 19 crisis is causing stress on their personal finances . Like the spread of the virus , financial shocks have been felt more in some places than others . In this study , SmartAsset looked at the states where residents have been financially hurting the most during COVID - 19 . We compared the 50 URLTOKEN states across six metrics . They include recent measures of unemployment along with measures of housing and food insecurity . For details on our data sources and how we put all the information together to create our final rankings , check out the Data and Methodology section below . Residents in populous states may be experiencing the largest financial fallout . California , Texas , Florida and New York are the most populous states in the URLTOKEN Those four states all rank within the top 10 states where residents are financially hurting the most due to the coronavirus pandemic , according to our findings . More specifically , they all fall within the 15 states in the study with the highest recent housing insecurity , and within the 25 states in the study with the most recent food insufficiency . Housing insecurity varies widely across states . The Census Bureau ’ s new Household Pulse Survey asks respondents if they missed last month ’ s rent or mortgage payment or if they were not confident that their household can pay next month ’ s rent or mortgage on time . In Iowa , fewer than 15 % of residents expressed concern about making housing payments during mid - May . By contrast , close to one in two Mississippi residents replied that they either missed last month ’ s payment or expected to be unable to pay the coming month ’ s bill . Residents in Louisiana have been hit hard financially during the coronavirus pandemic . With the third - highest poverty rate in the nation , close to 16 % of adults in Louisiana recently did not have enough food over the course of a week . Additionally , Louisiana had the 12th - highest percentage of residents , at approximately 29 % , report that they either missed last month ’ s rent or mortgage payment or were not confident that they could make next month ’ s payment on time . Many Michigan residents have been laid off in recent weeks . Michigan ’ s unemployment rate increased the third - most of any state during COVID - 19 ; its April 2020 unemployment rate marks a URLTOKEN percentage point increase from February 2020 . Unemployed persons in Michigan receive less in jobless compensation relative to those in other states . The unemployment replacement rate in the state under the CARES Act , or the ratio of average unemployment benefits received to the average worker ’ s salary , in Michigan is the 11th - lowest of all 50 states . According to data published by the University of Chicago , the average pre - COVID weekly unemployment benefit was $ 362 . With the additional $ 600 per week , the pandemic unemployment replacement rate is 133 % . Unemployment and food insufficiency in Ohio have been high in recent months according to BLS and Census data . The unemployment rate in April 2020 was URLTOKEN , the sixth - highest of all 50 states . Moreover , in mid - May , URLTOKEN of residents reported that they either sometimes or often did not have enough to eat during the previous seven days . This is the fifth - highest rate of residents reporting food insufficiency . In 2018 , URLTOKEN Mississippi residents fell below the poverty line , the highest percentage of residents for this metric in any state . The coronavirus pandemic seems to have exacerbated some common measures of poverty within the state . According to Census Bureau survey data collected in mid - May , more than 46 % of adults reported that they either missed last month ’ s rent or mortgage payment or have slight or no confidence that their household can pay next month ’ s rent or mortgage on time . Moreover , close 18 % of adults said that within the last week they either sometimes or often did not have enough to eat . Historically , a high percentage of residents across many Florida cities have been housing - cost burdened . Housing burdens in Florida may be exacerbated due to COVID - 19 . According to Census Bureau data from the Household Pulse Survey , more than 32 % of adults recently reported that they are facing housing insecurity , the second - highest rate of across all 50 states . Florida residents also reported the fourth - highest rate of food insufficiency during the same survey week . Though an individual filing for unemployment in New York could receive a weekly benefit of up to $ 504 , the average benefit is $ 417 . With the average worker earning about $ 800 per week , the pandemic unemployment replacement rate ( with the additional $ 600 ) is 127 % , the seventh - lowest in our study . More than one in eight New Yorkers may be currently filing for unemployment . April 2020 BLS data shows that URLTOKEN of New York ’ s labor force is unemployed . This marks a URLTOKEN percentage point increase from pre - COVID levels . Unemployment in Illinois rose sharply between February 2020 and April 2020 , increasing by URLTOKEN percentage points , the eighth - largest jump in our study . With that rise , Illinois ’ April 2020 unemployment rate was URLTOKEN , URLTOKEN points higher than the national average and the seventh - highest of all 50 states . Despite low historic poverty rates , recent survey data compiled on residents in Illinois shows a different picture . More than one in four adults recently reported housing insecurity , while about one in eight were experiencing food insufficiencies . In 2018 , Tennessee had the ninth - highest poverty rate of all 50 states , with URLTOKEN of residents falling below the federal poverty line . Economic changes due to coronavirus may exacerbate poverty within the state . Over the past two months , Tennessee saw the 14th - largest increase in unemployment , and its most recent unemployment rate from April 2020 ( URLTOKEN is the 18th - highest in the nation . Recent survey data from the Census shows that close to 25 % of Tennessee residents are housing insecure , while more than 11 % are food insufficient . Though the April 2020 unemployment rate in Texas was about two percentage points lower than the national rate , a high percentage of Texan residents have reported recent financial stress . In mid - May , more than 30 % of residents said that they either missed last month ’ s housing payment or did not have confidence they would be able to make the coming month ’ s payment . Additionally , close to 13 % of adult survey respondents said they did not always have enough to eat during the previous week . Relative to other states , that is the seventh - highest rate of housing insecurity and sixth - highest rate of food insufficiency . California had the 10th - highest April 2020 unemployment rate of any state , at URLTOKEN Beyond this , the unemployment replacement rate under the CARES Act in California is lower than in 10 other states . The average California worker earns $ 723 each week . Though the maximum weekly unemployment benefits in California is $ 450 , the average weekly benefit is $ 361 . Thus , the typical replacement rate is 50 % while the pandemic unemployment replacement rate , with the additional $ 600 federal benefit , is 133 % . To find the states where residents are financially hurting the most during COVID - 19 , SmartAsset looked at data for all 50 URLTOKEN states . We compared them across six metrics : April 2020 unemployment rate . Data comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics ’ Local Area Unemployment Statistics . Increase in unemployment during COVID - 19 . This is the percentage point difference between the February 2020 unemployment rate and April 2020 unemployment rate . Data comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics ’ Local Area Unemployment Statistics . Unemployment replacement rate under the CARES Act . This is the ratio of average unemployment benefit received to the average worker ’ s weekly salary .

Data comes from the University of Chicago ’ s Unemployment Insurance Calculator . Percentage of adults experiencing recent housing insecurity . This is the percentage of adults who missed last month ’ s rent or mortgage payment , or who have slight or no confidence that their household can pay next month ’ s rent or mortgage on time . Data comes from the Census Bureau ’ s Household Pulse Survey . Respondents were surveyed from May 14 , 2020 through May 19 , 2020 . Percentage of adults experiencing recent food insufficiency . This is the percentage of adults in households where there was either sometimes or often not enough to eat in the last seven days . Data comes from the Census Bureau ’ s Household Pulse Survey . Respondents were surveyed from May 14 , 2020 through May 19 , 2020 . Poverty rate . This is the percentage of residents living below the poverty line . Data comes from the URLTOKEN Census Bureau ’ s 1 - year American Community Survey . We ranked each state in every metric , giving a half weight to the first two metrics : April 2020 unemployment rate and increase in unemployment during COVID - 19 . We gave a full weight to all other metrics . Using those rankings , we found each state ’ s average ranking and used the average to determine a final score . The state with the highest average ranking received a score of 100 . The state with the lowest average ranking received a score of 0 .

0,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,statistics,"President Trump announced Monday he would temporarily suspend immigration as the coronavirus crisis continues . The public appears to agree this is a prudent idea . A poll conducted three days ago found that seven out of 10 voters support this measure . “ Seventy percent of registered voters believe the federal government should place a temporary ban on allowing people from any other country to enter the United States , ” reported a Scott Rasmussen national survey conducted late last week . “ That total includes 34 % who believe that even Americans living abroad should have to wait until the pandemic is over before returning , ” the poll analysis said . The temporary ban is supported by 82 % of Republicans , 66 % of Independents , and 64 % of Democrats — as well as 79 % of conservatives , 71 % of independents and 58 % of liberals . A majority of those who are not fans of the president also agree . “ Among those who strongly approve of President Trump , 84 % support the ban . Among those who strongly disapprove of the president , 57 % share that same view , ” the poll said . “ Overall , among all voters , just 15 % oppose a temporary ban . In no measured demographic group does opposition reach 25 % . ” Copyright © 2021 The Washington Times , LLC .

1,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,testimony,"Prof Sridhar , an Edinburgh University public health academic , is one of the most influential members of the Scottish Government ' s Covid - 19 advisory group . On Friday Ms Sturgeon said Scotland was edging towards ` ` total elimination ' ' of Covid - 19 after no new deaths were recorded on a weekday for the first time since March . Asked what she meant , Prof Sridhar told BBC Scotland ' s Sunday Politics programme ` ` a zero Covid Scotland , which means there ' s no acceptable level of number of cases and they get driven down to become negligible so we get the economy going and society going . ' ' She cited the strategy adopted in countries like New Zealand , where ` ` you get rid of community transmission and you just keep in place checks for any imported cases coming in , which might set off chains of infection . ' ' The academic said this was not the strategy being adopted in England , where she estimated there are between 5 , 000 and 6 , 000 new daily cases . Acknowledging the English strategy will not change before July 15 , when Scottish hotels and tourist attractions reopen , she said : ` ` The next best thing is to look across the world at Australia , Germany , even the United States . ` ` Look at the policies being put in place between states which have high incidence like Texas and Florida , and those with low incidence now like New York , New Jersey , Connecticut , and trying to find ways whether it ' s quarantine or other checks to make sure when there are clear differences in incidence , then you make sure you are catching those cases through screening , through quarantine , through testing . ' ' A Scottish Government spokesman said : ` ` To allow us to move out of lockdown it is critical that we keep transmission of the virus as low as possible – and that includes transmission from high to low risk areas . ` ` We are , in common with countries across the world , having to take unprecedented steps to deal with the challenges that the Covid - 19 pandemic brings .

1,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,testimony,"Washington ( AFP ) - President Donald Trump announced Tuesday a suspension of US funding to the World Health Organization because he said it had covered up the seriousness of the COVID - 19 outbreak in China before it spread around the world . Trump told a press conference he was instructing his administration to halt funding while ` ` a review is conducted to assess the World Health Organization ' s role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus . ' ' According to Trump , the WHO prevented transparency over the outbreak and the United States - - the UN body ' s biggest funder which provided $ 400 million last year - - will now ` ` discuss what we do with all that money that goes to the WHO . ' ' ` ` With the outbreak of the COVID - 19 pandemic , we have deep concerns whether America ' s generosity has been put to the best use possible . ' ' Trump ' s attack on the WHO reflects his belief that the organization is biased toward China and colluded to prevent the United States ' main economic rival from having to be open about the unfolding health disaster . He says this cost other countries crucial time to prepare and delayed decisions to stop international travel . ` ` The WHO ' s attack on travel restrictions put political correctness above life - saving measures , ' ' he said . ` ` Had the WHO done its job to get medical experts into China to objectively assess the situation on the ground and to call out China ' s lack of transparency , the outbreak could have been contained at its source with very little death , ' ' he said . ` ` This would have saved thousands of lives and avoided worldwide economic damage . Instead , the WHO willingly took China ' s assurances to face value . . . and defended the actions of the Chinese government , ' ' he said .

1,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,testimony,"© iStock Senior official estimates $ 30 billion in stimulus funds will be stolen through coronavirus scams A top official with the URLTOKEN Secret Service said Tuesday that coronavirus - related fraud could lead to $ 30 billion in federal relief funds being stolen by criminals . ` ` Congress has appropriated nearly $ 3 trillion to support the American economy , the largest - ever economic stimulus package in URLTOKEN history , ' ' Secret Service Assistant Director Michael D ' Ambrosio testified during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on coronavirus - related fraud . He emphasized that ` ` even if we assume a very low rate of fraud , of just 1 percent , we should still expect more than $ 30 billion will end up in the hands of criminals . And that is likely an underestimation of the risk , and just one portion of the full range of risks at play . ' ' The Secret Service has taken steps to counter these scams , with D ' Ambrosio saying the agency had disrupted ` ` hundreds ' ' of scams and prevented around $ 1 billion from being lost to malicious actors . ` ` Countering criminal schemes seeking to exploit the COVID - 19 pandemic has become a primary investigative focus for the URLTOKEN Secret Service , and will remain so over the coming years , ' ' D ' Ambrosio said . The COVID - 19 pandemic has led to a spike in scams against Americans , including those targeting small business relief funds and stimulus checks from the government . The Justice Department said the same month that it had notified internet domain hosts of hundreds of websites that were attempting to use coronavirus fears to scam or compromise network security . Associate Deputy Attorney General William Hughes testified at the same hearing on Tuesday that the Justice Department was also tracking attempts by cyber criminals to use the COVID - 19 pandemic to target both children and those working from home . ` ` Child predators on the internet see widespread closing of schools , stay at home orders , and the reliance on internet platforms as the primary means of communication as an opportunity to prey on children , ' ' Hughes said . ` ` Cyber criminals also see the widespread work from home posture of many American businesses as an opportunity to attack and infiltrate business computer networks , to disable systems or steal or hold hostage valuable data . ' ' Hughes vowed that the Justice Department would investigate and bring cases against these criminals ` ` for the foreseeable future . ' ' Craig Carpentino , the URLTOKEN attorney for the District of New Jersey , testified Tuesday that the rise in scams and cyber targeting during the pandemic was to be expected . ` ` When you put this kind of money out into the ether because you have to take care of society and take care of those who desperately need it , the cockroaches are going to come out of the dark and into the light , ' ' Carpentino said .",B-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony

1,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,testimony,"Retired Adm . William McRaven , a former US Navy SEAL commander and head of US Special Operations Command , says K - 12 education is vital to US national security . ` ` Unless we are giving opportunity and a quality education to the young men and women in the United States , then we wo n ' t have the right people to be able to make the right decisions about our national security , ' ' McRaven said . McRaven said the US needed to develop a ` ` culture of education ' ' within communities , particularly those where residents think they ca n ' t afford it or that their children are n ' t ` ` smart enough . ' ' ` ` There is a school out there for every man and woman in the United States — I do n ' t care what your educational capacity is , what you think it is , ' ' McRaven said . ` ` There is a school that will help you matriculate to the point of getting a degree . ' ' Visit Business Insider ' s homepage for more stories . While some former US military leaders have had offered witty one - liners when asked which national security threat keeps them up at night , one former commander had an unconventional answer : ` ` K - 12 education . ' ' Retired Adm . William McRaven , a former US Navy SEAL commander and head of US Special Operations Command , said he was ` ` the biggest fan ' ' of the younger generation of Americans and that education in grade school played a broader role in national security . ` ` When I was chancellor , I would have a lot of town hall meetings , or meetings with our alumni , and that question always came up , ' ' McRaven , who was chancellor of the University of Texas System , said at the Aspen Ideas Festival on June 29 . ` ` And they would always ask . . . ' What ' s your No . 1 national security issue ? ' ' ' ` ` I think my answer always surprised them , ' ' he added . McRaven , who stepped down from overseeing one of the largest US school systems in 2018 , said he stood by that thinking . McRaven at the University of Texas at Austin commencement . AP Photo / The University of Texas at Austin , Marsha Miller ` ` It was because I recognized that unless we are giving opportunity and a quality education to the young men and women in the United States , then we wo n ' t have the right people to be able to make the right decisions about our national security , ' ' McRaven said . ` ` They wo n ' t have an understanding of different cultures . They wo n ' t have an understand of different ideas . They wo n ' t be critical thinkers . ' ' ` ` So we have got to have an education system within the United States that really does teach and educate young men and women to think critically , to look outside their kind of small microcosm because if we do n ' t develop those great folks , then our national security in the long run may be in jeopardy , ' ' McRaven added . McRaven recommended the US develop a ` ` culture of education ' ' within communities , particular those where residents believe they can not afford an education or where they think their children are n ' t ` ` smart enough . ' ' ` ` There is a school out there for every man and woman in the United States — I do n ' t care what your educational capacity is , what you think it is , ' ' McRaven said . ` ` There is a school that will help you matriculate to the point of getting a degree . ' ' McRaven held numerous leadership positions within the special - operations community during his 37 years in the Navy , including overseeing the successful military raid that killed al - Qaida leader Osama bin Laden in 2011 . His remarks echo those of former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , who in 2013 said the ` ` crisis in K - 12 education is our greatest national security crisis today . ' ' As a member of a Council on Foreign Relations education task force in 2012 , Rice helped develop a report that found ` ` educational failure puts the United States ' future economic prosperity , global position , and physical safety at risk . ' ' ` ` Human capital will determine power in the current century , and the failure to produce that capital will undermine America ' s security , ' ' the report said . ` ` Large , undereducated swaths of the population damage the ability of the United States to physically defend itself , protect its secure information , conduct diplomacy , and grow its economy .

1,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,testimony,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday said that the next round of coronavirus legislation could include an additional round of stimulus checks aimed at helping low - income Americans . Asked at one of three public events in his home state of Kentucky if the relief bill would include more direct payments , McConnell said it ` ` could well . ' ' ` ` I think the people who have been hit the hardest are people who make about $ 40 , 000 a year or less , many of them work in the hospitality industry . The hospitality industry , as all of you know , just got rim - racked - hotels , restaurants - and so that could well be a part of it , ' ' McConnell said . House Democrats have passed a $ 3 trillion bill that includes another round of direct deposits and checks . Republicans have been critical of the House bill , but President Donald Trump and some Senate Republicans have said they ' re open to including another round of direct payments in future legislation . Speaking at a separate event earlier Monday , McConnell said he ' d be putting forward his own legislation after the Senate returns on July 20 . ` ` I ' ll be unveiling something which will be a starting point in a few weeks and we ' ll be dealing with the administration and the Democrats , ' ' McConnell said . ` ` I ca n ' t comfortably predict we ' re going to come together and pass it unanimously like we did a few months ago , ' ' he added . ` ` The atmosphere has become more political than it was in March but I think we will do something . The country needs one last boost . ' ' McConnell said one of his top priorities for the bill would be liability protection to protect businesses from coronavirus - related litigation . ` ` This is not just for businesses this is for hospitals , doctors , nurses , nonprofits , universities , colleges , k - 12 , so that people who acted in good faith during this crisis are not confronted with a second epidemic of lawsuits in the wake of a pandemic that we ' re already struggling with , ' ' he said . He also reiterated that , as far as he is concerned , the next stimulus bill would be the last . ` ` This will have to be the last rescue package because we now have a debt the size of our economy for the first time since World War 2 . We can not keep doing this , ' ' he said .",B-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony

0,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,testimony,"Prof Sridhar , an Edinburgh University public health academic , is one of the most influential members of the Scottish Government ' s Covid - 19 advisory group . On Friday Ms Sturgeon said Scotland was edging towards ` ` total elimination ' ' of Covid - 19 after no new deaths were recorded on a weekday for the first time since March . Asked what she meant , Prof Sridhar told BBC Scotland ' s Sunday Politics programme ` ` a zero Covid Scotland , which means there ' s no acceptable level of number of cases and they get driven down to become negligible so we get the economy going and society going . ' ' She cited the strategy adopted in countries like New Zealand , where ` ` you get rid of community transmission and you just keep in place checks for any imported cases coming in , which might set off chains of infection . ' ' The academic said this was not the strategy being adopted in England , where she estimated there are between 5 , 000 and 6 , 000 new daily cases . Acknowledging the English strategy will not change before July 15 , when Scottish hotels and tourist attractions reopen , she said : ` ` The next best thing is to look across the world at Australia , Germany , even the United States . ` ` Look at the policies being put in place between states which have high incidence like Texas and Florida , and those with low incidence now like New York , New Jersey , Connecticut , and trying to find ways whether it ' s quarantine or other checks to make sure when there are clear differences in incidence , then you make sure you are catching those cases through screening , through quarantine , through testing . ' ' A Scottish Government spokesman said : ` ` To allow us to move out of lockdown it is critical that we keep transmission of the virus as low as possible – and that includes transmission from high to low risk areas . ` ` We are , in common with countries across the world , having to take unprecedented steps to deal with the challenges that the Covid - 19 pandemic brings .

0,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,testimony,"Washington ( AFP ) - President Donald Trump announced Tuesday a suspension of US funding to the World Health Organization because he said it had covered up the seriousness of the COVID - 19 outbreak in China before it spread around the world . Trump told a press conference he was instructing his administration to halt funding while ` ` a review is conducted to assess the World Health Organization ' s role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus . ' ' According to Trump , the WHO prevented transparency over the outbreak and the United States - - the UN body ' s biggest funder which provided $ 400 million last year - - will now ` ` discuss what we do with all that money that goes to the WHO . ' ' ` ` With the outbreak of the COVID - 19 pandemic , we have deep concerns whether America ' s generosity has been put to the best use possible . ' ' Trump ' s attack on the WHO reflects his belief that the organization is biased toward China and colluded to prevent the United States ' main economic rival from having to be open about the unfolding health disaster . He says this cost other countries crucial time to prepare and delayed decisions to stop international travel . ` ` The WHO ' s attack on travel restrictions put political correctness above life - saving measures , ' ' he said . ` ` Had the WHO done its job to get medical experts into China to objectively assess the situation on the ground and to call out China ' s lack of transparency , the outbreak could have been contained at its source with very little death , ' ' he said . ` ` This would have saved thousands of lives and avoided worldwide economic damage . Instead , the WHO willingly took China ' s assurances to face value . . . and defended the actions of the Chinese government , ' ' he said . Critics have pointed out that for weeks after the coronavirus epidemic began unfolding , Trump frequently praised Beijing ' s response and downplayed the danger it posed at home .",B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O B-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O I-testimony I-testimony B-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O I-testimony I-testimony O O O O O O I-testimony O I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O I-testimony I-testimony B-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O B-assumption I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O O I-testimony O I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O I-testimony I-testimony B-assumption I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O O I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O B-assumption I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O B-assumption I-testimony I-assumption I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O,https://news.yahoo.com/trump-announces-funding-halt-world-health-organization-230704690.html
0,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,testimony,"© iStock Senior official estimates $ 30 billion in stimulus funds will be stolen through coronavirus scams A top official with the URLTOKEN Secret Service said Tuesday that coronavirus - related fraud could lead to $ 30 billion in federal relief funds being stolen by criminals . ` ` Congress has appropriated nearly $ 3 trillion to support the American economy , the largest - ever economic stimulus package in URLTOKEN history , ' ' Secret Service Assistant Director Michael D ' Ambrosio testified during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on coronavirus - related fraud . He emphasized that ` ` even if we assume a very low rate of fraud , of just 1 percent , we should still expect more than $ 30 billion will end up in the hands of criminals . And that is likely an underestimation of the risk , and just one portion of the full range of risks at play . ' ' The Secret Service has taken steps to counter these scams , with D ' Ambrosio saying the agency had disrupted ` ` hundreds ' ' of scams and prevented around $ 1 billion from being lost to malicious actors . ` ` Countering criminal schemes seeking to exploit the COVID - 19 pandemic has become a primary investigative focus for the URLTOKEN Secret Service , and will remain so over the coming years , ' ' D ' Ambrosio said . The COVID - 19 pandemic has led to a spike in scams against Americans , including those targeting small business relief funds and stimulus checks from the government . The Justice Department said the same month that it had notified internet domain hosts of hundreds of websites that were attempting to use coronavirus fears to scam or compromise network security . Associate Deputy Attorney General William Hughes testified at the same hearing on Tuesday that the Justice Department was also tracking attempts by cyber criminals to use the COVID - 19 pandemic to target both children and those working from home . ` ` Child predators on the internet see widespread closing of schools , stay at home orders , and the reliance on internet platforms as the primary means of communication as an opportunity to prey on children , ' ' Hughes said . ` ` Cyber criminals also see the widespread work from home posture of many American businesses as an opportunity to attack and infiltrate business computer networks , to disable systems or steal or hold hostage valuable data . ' ' Hughes vowed that the Justice Department would investigate and bring cases against these criminals ` ` for the foreseeable future . ' ' Craig Carpentino , the URLTOKEN attorney for the District of New Jersey , testified Tuesday that the rise in scams and cyber targeting during the pandemic was to be expected . ` ` When you put this kind of money out into the ether because you have to take care of society and take care of those who desperately need it , the cockroaches are going to come out of the dark and into the light , ' ' Carpentino said .",B-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony

0,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,testimony,"Retired Adm . William McRaven , a former US Navy SEAL commander and head of US Special Operations Command , says K - 12 education is vital to US national security . ` ` Unless we are giving opportunity and a quality education to the young men and women in the United States , then we wo n ' t have the right people to be able to make the right decisions about our national security , ' ' McRaven said . McRaven said the US needed to develop a ` ` culture of education ' ' within communities , particularly those where residents think they ca n ' t afford it or that their children are n ' t ` ` smart enough . ' ' ` ` There is a school out there for every man and woman in the United States — I do n ' t care what your educational capacity is , what you think it is , ' ' McRaven said . ` ` There is a school that will help you matriculate to the point of getting a degree . ' ' Visit Business Insider ' s homepage for more stories . While some former US military leaders have had offered witty one - liners when asked which national security threat keeps them up at night , one former commander had an unconventional answer : ` ` K - 12 education . ' ' Retired Adm . William McRaven , a former US Navy SEAL commander and head of US Special Operations Command , said he was ` ` the biggest fan ' ' of the younger generation of Americans and that education in grade school played a broader role in national security . ` ` When I was chancellor , I would have a lot of town hall meetings , or meetings with our alumni , and that question always came up , ' ' McRaven , who was chancellor of the University of Texas System , said at the Aspen Ideas Festival on June 29 . ` ` And they would always ask . . . ' What ' s your No . 1 national security issue ? ' ' ' ` ` I think my answer always surprised them , ' ' he added . McRaven , who stepped down from overseeing one of the largest US school systems in 2018 , said he stood by that thinking . McRaven at the University of Texas at Austin commencement . AP Photo / The University of Texas at Austin , Marsha Miller ` ` It was because I recognized that unless we are giving opportunity and a quality education to the young men and women in the United States , then we wo n ' t have the right people to be able to make the right decisions about our national security , ' ' McRaven said . ` ` They wo n ' t have an understanding of different cultures . They wo n ' t have an understand of different ideas . They wo n ' t be critical thinkers . ' ' ` ` So we have got to have an education system within the United States that really does teach and educate young men and women to think critically , to look outside their kind of small microcosm because if we do n ' t develop those great folks , then our national security in the long run may be in jeopardy , ' ' McRaven added . McRaven recommended the US develop a ` ` culture of education ' ' within communities , particular those where residents believe they can not afford an education or where they think their children are n ' t ` ` smart enough . ' ' ` ` There is a school out there for every man and woman in the United States — I do n ' t care what your educational capacity is , what you think it is , ' ' McRaven said . ` ` There is a school that will help you matriculate to the point of getting a degree . ' ' McRaven held numerous leadership positions within the special - operations community during his 37 years in the Navy , including overseeing the successful military raid that killed al - Qaida leader Osama bin Laden in 2011 . His remarks echo those of former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , who in 2013 said the ` ` crisis in K - 12 education is our greatest national security crisis today . ' ' As a member of a Council on Foreign Relations education task force in 2012 , Rice helped develop a report that found ` ` educational failure puts the United States ' future economic prosperity , global position , and physical safety at risk . ' ' ` ` Human capital will determine power in the current century , and the failure to produce that capital will undermine America ' s security , ' ' the report said . ` ` Large , undereducated swaths of the population damage the ability of the United States to physically defend itself , protect its secure information , conduct diplomacy , and grow its economy .

0,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,testimony,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday said that the next round of coronavirus legislation could include an additional round of stimulus checks aimed at helping low - income Americans . Asked at one of three public events in his home state of Kentucky if the relief bill would include more direct payments , McConnell said it ` ` could well . ' ' ` ` I think the people who have been hit the hardest are people who make about $ 40 , 000 a year or less , many of them work in the hospitality industry . The hospitality industry , as all of you know , just got rim - racked - hotels , restaurants - and so that could well be a part of it , ' ' McConnell said . House Democrats have passed a $ 3 trillion bill that includes another round of direct deposits and checks . Republicans have been critical of the House bill , but President Donald Trump and some Senate Republicans have said they ' re open to including another round of direct payments in future legislation . Speaking at a separate event earlier Monday , McConnell said he ' d be putting forward his own legislation after the Senate returns on July 20 . ` ` I ' ll be unveiling something which will be a starting point in a few weeks and we ' ll be dealing with the administration and the Democrats , ' ' McConnell said . ` ` I ca n ' t comfortably predict we ' re going to come together and pass it unanimously like we did a few months ago , ' ' he added . ` ` The atmosphere has become more political than it was in March but I think we will do something . The country needs one last boost . ' ' McConnell said one of his top priorities for the bill would be liability protection to protect businesses from coronavirus - related litigation . ` ` This is not just for businesses this is for hospitals , doctors , nurses , nonprofits , universities , colleges , k - 12 , so that people who acted in good faith during this crisis are not confronted with a second epidemic of lawsuits in the wake of a pandemic that we ' re already struggling with , ' ' he said . He also reiterated that , as far as he is concerned , the next stimulus bill would be the last . ` ` This will have to be the last rescue package because we now have a debt the size of our economy for the first time since World War 2 . We can not keep doing this , ' ' he said .",B-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony

1,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,common,"The Texas Supreme Court on Thursday night lifted its pause on eviction and debt collection proceedings , permitting them to resume next week amid the novel coronavirus spread . Trials , hearings and proceedings for residential evictions may resume Tuesday , May 19 , and beginning May 26 , warnings may be posted and orders may be issued . In eviction proceedings filed from March 27 through July 25 , tenants covered under provisions of the Coronavirus Aid , Relief , and Economic Security Act passed by Congress are exempt . The National Low Income Housing Coalition launched a searchable database that allows renters to look up if their property is exempt under the federal moratorium . The court also issued an emergency order that allows debt collections to resume May 18 . It notes that debtors and receivers may request a hearing , either in - person or remote , to determine what funds may be attributable to a stimulus payment under the CARES Act . The order expires August 12 , and both may be extended by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court . The Texas Supreme Court had first temporarily halted evictions in late March . Since the start of the pandemic , over 2 million Texans have filed unemployment claims . Earlier this month , the city of Fort Worth launched a $ URLTOKEN million emergency fund to help low - to moderate - income residents with rent , mortgage and utilities . But activists have called on the city to institute a grace period of two to three months to allow tenants to come up with rent after an eviction notice is given . TIPS FOR RENTERS WHO NEED ASSISTANCE Call 817 - 392 - 5720 to apply for rental assistance from the city of Fort Worth ; call 817 - 850 - 7940 for a Tarrant County help line regarding rental and utility assistance . A notice to vacate is not an eviction . It begins the process and does not force you to immediately leave your home . An eviction can only be carried out if signed by a court . And if a landlord does not provide a notice to vacate , the landlord may not begin an eviction process .

1,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,common,"MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE SUBJECT : Excluding Illegal Aliens From the Apportionment Section 1 . Background . In order to apportion Representatives among the States , the Constitution requires the enumeration of the population of the United States every 10 years and grants the Congress the power and discretion to direct the manner in which this decennial census is conducted ( URLTOKEN Const . art . I , sec . 2 , cl . 3 ) . The Congress has charged the Secretary of Commerce ( the Secretary ) with directing the conduct of the decennial census in such form and content as the Secretary may determine ( 13 URLTOKEN 141 ( a ) ) . By the direction of the Congress , the Secretary then transmits to the President the report of his tabulation of total population for the apportionment of Representatives in the Congress ( 13 URLTOKEN 141 ( b ) ) . The President , by law , makes the final determination regarding the “ whole number of persons in each State , ” which determines the number of Representatives to be apportioned to each State , and transmits these determinations and accompanying census data to the Congress ( 2 URLTOKEN 2a ( a ) ) . The Congress has provided that it is “ the President ’ s personal transmittal of the report to Congress ” that “ settles the apportionment ” of Representatives among the States , and the President ’ s discretion to settle the apportionment is more than “ ceremonial or ministerial ” and is essential “ to the integrity of the process ” ( Franklin v . Massachusetts , 505 URLTOKEN 788 , 799 , and 800 ( 1992 ) ) . The Constitution does not specifically define which persons must be included in the apportionment base . Although the Constitution requires the “ persons in each State , excluding Indians not taxed , ” to be enumerated in the census , that requirement has never been understood to include in the apportionment base every individual physically present within a State ’ s boundaries at the time of the census . Instead , the term “ persons in each State ” has been interpreted to mean that only the “ inhabitants ” of each State should be included . Determining which persons should be considered “ inhabitants ” for the purpose of apportionment requires the exercise of judgment . For example , aliens who are only temporarily in the United States , such as for business or tourism , and certain foreign diplomatic personnel are “ persons ” who have been excluded from the apportionment base in past censuses . Conversely , the Constitution also has never been understood to exclude every person who is not physically “ in ” a State at the time of the census . For example , overseas Federal personnel have , at various times , been included in and excluded from the populations of the States in which they maintained their homes of record . The discretion delegated to the executive branch to determine who qualifies as an “ inhabitant ” includes authority to exclude from the apportionment base aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status . In Executive Order 13880 of July 11 , 2019 ( Collecting Information About Citizenship Status in Connection With the Decennial Census ) , I instructed executive departments and agencies to share information with the Department of Commerce , to the extent permissible and consistent with law , to allow the Secretary to obtain accurate data on the number of citizens , non - citizens , and illegal aliens in the country . As the Attorney General and I explained at the time that order was signed , data on illegal aliens could be relevant for the purpose of conducting the apportionment , and we intended to examine that issue . Sec . 2 . Policy . ) , to the maximum extent feasible and consistent with the discretion delegated to the executive branch . Excluding these illegal aliens from the apportionment base is more consonant with the principles of representative democracy underpinning our system of Government . Many of these aliens entered the country illegally in the first place . Increasing congressional representation based on the presence of aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status would also create perverse incentives encouraging violations of Federal law . States adopting policies that encourage illegal aliens to enter this country and that hobble Federal efforts to enforce the immigration laws passed by the Congress should not be rewarded with greater representation in the House of Representatives . Current estimates suggest that one State is home to more than URLTOKEN million illegal aliens , constituting more than 6 percent of the State ’ s entire population . Including these illegal aliens in the population of the State for the purpose of apportionment could result in the allocation of two or three more congressional seats than would otherwise be allocated . I have accordingly determined that respect for the law and protection of the integrity of the democratic process warrant the exclusion of illegal aliens from the apportionment base , to the extent feasible and to the maximum extent of the President ’ s discretion under the law . Sec . 3 . Excluding Illegal Aliens from the Apportionment Base . In preparing his report to the President under section 141 ( b ) of title 13 , United States Code , the Secretary shall take all appropriate action , consistent with the Constitution and other applicable law , to provide information permitting the President , to the extent practicable , to exercise the President ’ s discretion to carry out the policy set forth in section 2 of this memorandum . The Secretary shall also include in that report information tabulated according to the methodology set forth in Final 2020 Census Residence Criteria and Residence Situations , 83 Fed . Reg . 5525 ( Feb . 8 , 2018 ) . Sec . 4 . General Provisions . ( a ) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect : ( i ) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency , or the head thereof ; or ( ii ) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary , administrative , or legislative proposals . ( b ) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations . ( c ) This memorandum is not intended to , and does not , create any right or benefit , substantive or procedural , enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States , its departments , agencies , or entities , its officers , employees , or agents , or any other person .",O O O O O O O O O I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O O O O O O O O

1,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,common,"© Getty Images A judge ' s decision that it was in the best interest of two children for their mother to lose parental rights was correct , the state Supreme Court found , reversing an earlier decision that such a move was based on shaky facts . Two Arizona nonprofits are suing Phoenix in federal court for excluding some immigrants from the city ' s rental and mortgage assistance programs that support residents impacted by COVID - 19 . Phoenix received almost $ 300 million from the Coronavirus Relief Fund , part of Congress ' $ URLTOKEN trillion CARES Act package aimed at countering the financial impacts of COVID - 19 . The Phoenix City Council allocated more than $ 25 million of their funds to rental , mortgage and utility assistance for residents who have lost wages because of COVID - 19 . Start the day smarter . Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning . The William E . Morris Institute for Justice and the Arizona Center for Law in the Public Interest sued Phoenix in federal court in mid - July , alleging the city illegally excluded some immigrants from the assistance program . ` ` These are funds to keep people in their homes . For health and safety reasons , I think it benefits everyone when people can stay in their homes , ' ' William E . Morris Institute for Justice Director Ellen Katz said . You can also text us story ideas and questions . We promise not to use your number for anything else . You can also text us story ideas and questions . We promise not to use your number for anything else . According to the nonprofits , the city is using a 1996 federal law to define which immigrants qualify for the assistance program . This definition excludes some groups of immigrants , including people with Temporary Protected Status , asylum applicants and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , or DACA , recipients . In the lawsuit , the organizations claim that the federal CARES funds the city is using for the housing assistance program is not subject to restriction based on immigrant status . They argue that the CARES Act does not include restrictions on immigrant eligibility and that the funds are exempt from the 1996 law because they are ` ` short - term , non - cash , in - kind emergency disaster relief . ' ' ` ` These funds fit squarely within that exception , ' ' Katz said . Katz said Phoenix distributes the housing assistance funds directly to landlords , mortgage companies and utility companies . The city never gives the money directly to a renter or homeowner , which makes the money ` ` non - cash ' ' and ` ` in - kind . ' ' Are you a health care worker or a COVID - 19 patient ? Help us learn more about coronavirus impact in Arizona by telling us your story . The organizations filed the lawsuit in federal court , alleging that the city ' s immigrant eligibility requirements are more restrictive than federal law . They argue the city is violating the Supremacy Clause of the URLTOKEN Constitution , which prohibits states from preempting federal law . The William E . Morris Institute for Justice and the Arizona Center for Law in the Public Interest filed the lawsuit on behalf of two local immigrants rights organizations , Poder in Action and the Arizona Dream Act Coalition . Poder in Action held a rally in mid - May to protest the city ' s lack of financial support for the immigrant community during the COVID - 19 pandemic . To promote social distancing , participants demonstrated from their vehicles in a 1½ mile drive from the Arizona Capitol to Phoenix City Hall . ` ` Undocumented people are the backbone of Phoenix economically , ' ' Poder in Action Executive Director Viri Hernandez said . ` ` Undocumented people have been the ones out there making sure Phoenix is running and clean . . . while others are privileged to stay and work from home . ' ' A Phoenix spokesperson said the city would not comment on pending litigation . In early May , the Phoenix City Council briefly discussed whether it could provide financial assistance to people without legal status with the CARES funding the city received from the feds . While the CARES Act itself does not specify that funding recipients must be legal URLTOKEN residents , Phoenix City Attorney Cris Meyer told the council that the funds are likely subject to other federal and state laws that require legal status .

1,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,common,"House Republicans on Monday night offered a detailed critique of what they called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ’ s “ socialist wish list ” in House Democrats ’ $ URLTOKEN trillion proposal for responding to the coronavirus outbreak . “ Speaker Pelosi unveiled legislation aimed at exploiting the COVID - 19 public health crisis by attempting to force the inclusion of a socialist wish list of policies that have nothing to do with the public health and economic emergency , ” said House Minority Whip Steve Scalise , Louisiana Republican . Under the heading of “ Union Giveaways ” : • Nullifies the White House executive orders on federal collective bargaining and codifies taxpayer - funded union official time . • Requires a labor union representative on every airline ’ s board of directors . • Multiemployer pension bailout lacking needed reforms . • Permanently raises the minimum wage to $ 15 for any business that receives federal aid for COVID - 19 . • Cancels all debt owed by the URLTOKEN Postal Service to the Treasury . Under the heading “ Green New Deal priorities ” : • Requires all airlines that receive assistance to offset carbon emissions for domestic flights by 2025 . • Includes a $ 1 billion “ cash for clunkers ” airplane program where the Transportation Department buys fuel - inefficient planes from airlines in exchange for agreeing to buy new ones . • Includes expansive new tax - credit for solar and wind energy . • Mandates how states must run elections , including the nationalization of ballot harvesting , requiring early voting , same day registration , and no - excuse vote by mail . • Puts states at risk of costly litigation if they are unable to implement these stringent mandates ahead of the 2020 election . • Requires the Homeland Security Department to automatically extend visas and work authorizations expiring within the next year , including those with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and Temporary Protected Status , for an amount of time equal to their prior visa , authorization or status . • Limits Customs and Border Patrol ’ s ability to shutdown processing centers if there is a health crisis on the border and requires CBP to assure the timely adjudication of asylums applications . • Would allow certain funding to go to sanctuary cities . • Permanent changes to who can serve on corporate boards of directors for companies that receive assistance for payroll and operating costs . • Mandatory disclosure on supply chain management . • Requires board diversity disclosure for all publicly traded companies . • Ban on all federal rulemaking including non - COVID 19 proposals ( extends 30 days after emergency ) “ in an attempt to delay the current administration from promulgating actions House Democrats disagree with . ” • Virtually rewrites the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program policy with no reference to COVID - 19 and permanently disallows rulemaking pertaining to work requirements and eligibility . • Permanent expansion of Obamacare entitlement , “ putting the American taxpayer on the hook for endless and unchecked health insurance spending and would remove all incentives for insurers to reduce the cost of health insurance . ” Mr . Scalise said the Democrats ’ bill also excludes bipartisan health - care provision in the Senate bill , including a proposal to expand telehealth access for home dialysis patients , hospice and home health patients ; and a measure to prevent a payment reduction for durable medical equipment to help patients ’ better transition from the hospital to home . “ Instead of working in a bipartisan , bicameral way to provide this immediate relief , the speaker has proposed legislation that includes highly partisan provisions while excluding key patient care provisions that would have a real impact on Americans affected by COVID - 19 , ” Mr . Scalise told his Republican colleagues .",B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote

0,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,common,"The Texas Supreme Court on Thursday night lifted its pause on eviction and debt collection proceedings , permitting them to resume next week amid the novel coronavirus spread . Trials , hearings and proceedings for residential evictions may resume Tuesday , May 19 , and beginning May 26 , warnings may be posted and orders may be issued . In eviction proceedings filed from March 27 through July 25 , tenants covered under provisions of the Coronavirus Aid , Relief , and Economic Security Act passed by Congress are exempt . The National Low Income Housing Coalition launched a searchable database that allows renters to look up if their property is exempt under the federal moratorium . The court also issued an emergency order that allows debt collections to resume May 18 . It notes that debtors and receivers may request a hearing , either in - person or remote , to determine what funds may be attributable to a stimulus payment under the CARES Act . The order expires August 12 , and both may be extended by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court . The Texas Supreme Court had first temporarily halted evictions in late March . Since the start of the pandemic , over 2 million Texans have filed unemployment claims . Earlier this month , the city of Fort Worth launched a $ URLTOKEN million emergency fund to help low - to moderate - income residents with rent , mortgage and utilities . But activists have called on the city to institute a grace period of two to three months to allow tenants to come up with rent after an eviction notice is given . TIPS FOR RENTERS WHO NEED ASSISTANCE Call 817 - 392 - 5720 to apply for rental assistance from the city of Fort Worth ; call 817 - 850 - 7940 for a Tarrant County help line regarding rental and utility assistance . A notice to vacate is not an eviction . It begins the process and does not force you to immediately leave your home . An eviction can only be carried out if signed by a court . And if a landlord does not provide a notice to vacate , the landlord may not begin an eviction process .

0,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,common,"MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE SUBJECT : Excluding Illegal Aliens From the Apportionment Section 1 . Background . In order to apportion Representatives among the States , the Constitution requires the enumeration of the population of the United States every 10 years and grants the Congress the power and discretion to direct the manner in which this decennial census is conducted ( URLTOKEN Const . art . I , sec . 2 , cl . 3 ) . The Congress has charged the Secretary of Commerce ( the Secretary ) with directing the conduct of the decennial census in such form and content as the Secretary may determine ( 13 URLTOKEN 141 ( a ) ) . By the direction of the Congress , the Secretary then transmits to the President the report of his tabulation of total population for the apportionment of Representatives in the Congress ( 13 URLTOKEN 141 ( b ) ) . The President , by law , makes the final determination regarding the “ whole number of persons in each State , ” which determines the number of Representatives to be apportioned to each State , and transmits these determinations and accompanying census data to the Congress ( 2 URLTOKEN 2a ( a ) ) . The Congress has provided that it is “ the President ’ s personal transmittal of the report to Congress ” that “ settles the apportionment ” of Representatives among the States , and the President ’ s discretion to settle the apportionment is more than “ ceremonial or ministerial ” and is essential “ to the integrity of the process ” ( Franklin v . Massachusetts , 505 URLTOKEN 788 , 799 , and 800 ( 1992 ) ) . The Constitution does not specifically define which persons must be included in the apportionment base . Although the Constitution requires the “ persons in each State , excluding Indians not taxed , ” to be enumerated in the census , that requirement has never been understood to include in the apportionment base every individual physically present within a State ’ s boundaries at the time of the census . Instead , the term “ persons in each State ” has been interpreted to mean that only the “ inhabitants ” of each State should be included . Determining which persons should be considered “ inhabitants ” for the purpose of apportionment requires the exercise of judgment . For example , aliens who are only temporarily in the United States , such as for business or tourism , and certain foreign diplomatic personnel are “ persons ” who have been excluded from the apportionment base in past censuses . Conversely , the Constitution also has never been understood to exclude every person who is not physically “ in ” a State at the time of the census . For example , overseas Federal personnel have , at various times , been included in and excluded from the populations of the States in which they maintained their homes of record . The discretion delegated to the executive branch to determine who qualifies as an “ inhabitant ” includes authority to exclude from the apportionment base aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status . In Executive Order 13880 of July 11 , 2019 ( Collecting Information About Citizenship Status in Connection With the Decennial Census ) , I instructed executive departments and agencies to share information with the Department of Commerce , to the extent permissible and consistent with law , to allow the Secretary to obtain accurate data on the number of citizens , non - citizens , and illegal aliens in the country . As the Attorney General and I explained at the time that order was signed , data on illegal aliens could be relevant for the purpose of conducting the apportionment , and we intended to examine that issue . Sec . 2 . Policy . ) , to the maximum extent feasible and consistent with the discretion delegated to the executive branch . Excluding these illegal aliens from the apportionment base is more consonant with the principles of representative democracy underpinning our system of Government . Many of these aliens entered the country illegally in the first place . Increasing congressional representation based on the presence of aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status would also create perverse incentives encouraging violations of Federal law . States adopting policies that encourage illegal aliens to enter this country and that hobble Federal efforts to enforce the immigration laws passed by the Congress should not be rewarded with greater representation in the House of Representatives . Current estimates suggest that one State is home to more than URLTOKEN million illegal aliens , constituting more than 6 percent of the State ’ s entire population . Including these illegal aliens in the population of the State for the purpose of apportionment could result in the allocation of two or three more congressional seats than would otherwise be allocated . I have accordingly determined that respect for the law and protection of the integrity of the democratic process warrant the exclusion of illegal aliens from the apportionment base , to the extent feasible and to the maximum extent of the President ’ s discretion under the law . Sec . 3 . Excluding Illegal Aliens from the Apportionment Base . In preparing his report to the President under section 141 ( b ) of title 13 , United States Code , the Secretary shall take all appropriate action , consistent with the Constitution and other applicable law , to provide information permitting the President , to the extent practicable , to exercise the President ’ s discretion to carry out the policy set forth in section 2 of this memorandum . The Secretary shall also include in that report information tabulated according to the methodology set forth in Final 2020 Census Residence Criteria and Residence Situations , 83 Fed . Reg . 5525 ( Feb . 8 , 2018 ) . Sec . 4 . General Provisions . ( a ) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect : ( i ) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency , or the head thereof ; or ( ii ) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary , administrative , or legislative proposals . ( b ) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations . ( c ) This memorandum is not intended to , and does not , create any right or benefit , substantive or procedural , enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States , its departments , agencies , or entities , its officers , employees , or agents , or any other person .",O O O O O O O O O I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption I-assumption O O O O O O O O

0,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,common,"© Getty Images A judge ' s decision that it was in the best interest of two children for their mother to lose parental rights was correct , the state Supreme Court found , reversing an earlier decision that such a move was based on shaky facts . Two Arizona nonprofits are suing Phoenix in federal court for excluding some immigrants from the city ' s rental and mortgage assistance programs that support residents impacted by COVID - 19 . Phoenix received almost $ 300 million from the Coronavirus Relief Fund , part of Congress ' $ URLTOKEN trillion CARES Act package aimed at countering the financial impacts of COVID - 19 . The Phoenix City Council allocated more than $ 25 million of their funds to rental , mortgage and utility assistance for residents who have lost wages because of COVID - 19 . Start the day smarter . Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning . The William E . Morris Institute for Justice and the Arizona Center for Law in the Public Interest sued Phoenix in federal court in mid - July , alleging the city illegally excluded some immigrants from the assistance program . ` ` These are funds to keep people in their homes . For health and safety reasons , I think it benefits everyone when people can stay in their homes , ' ' William E . Morris Institute for Justice Director Ellen Katz said .

We promise not to use your number for anything else . According to the nonprofits , the city is using a 1996 federal law to define which immigrants qualify for the assistance program . This definition excludes some groups of immigrants , including people with Temporary Protected Status , asylum applicants and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , or DACA , recipients . In the lawsuit , the organizations claim that the federal CARES funds the city is using for the housing assistance program is not subject to restriction based on immigrant status . They argue that the CARES Act does not include restrictions on immigrant eligibility and that the funds are exempt from the 1996 law because they are ` ` short - term , non - cash , in - kind emergency disaster relief . ' ' ` ` These funds fit squarely within that exception , ' ' Katz said . Katz said Phoenix distributes the housing assistance funds directly to landlords , mortgage companies and utility companies . The city never gives the money directly to a renter or homeowner , which makes the money ` ` non - cash ' ' and ` ` in - kind . ' ' Are you a health care worker or a COVID - 19 patient ? Help us learn more about coronavirus impact in Arizona by telling us your story . The organizations filed the lawsuit in federal court , alleging that the city ' s immigrant eligibility requirements are more restrictive than federal law . They argue the city is violating the Supremacy Clause of the URLTOKEN Constitution , which prohibits states from preempting federal law . The William E . Morris Institute for Justice and the Arizona Center for Law in the Public Interest filed the lawsuit on behalf of two local immigrants rights organizations , Poder in Action and the Arizona Dream Act Coalition . Poder in Action held a rally in mid - May to protest the city ' s lack of financial support for the immigrant community during the COVID - 19 pandemic . To promote social distancing , participants demonstrated from their vehicles in a 1½ mile drive from the Arizona Capitol to Phoenix City Hall . ` ` Undocumented people are the backbone of Phoenix economically , ' ' Poder in Action Executive Director Viri Hernandez said . ` ` Undocumented people have been the ones out there making sure Phoenix is running and clean . . . while others are privileged to stay and work from home . ' ' A Phoenix spokesperson said the city would not comment on pending litigation . In early May , the Phoenix City Council briefly discussed whether it could provide financial assistance to people without legal status with the CARES funding the city received from the feds . While the CARES Act itself does not specify that funding recipients must be legal URLTOKEN residents , Phoenix City Attorney Cris Meyer told the council that the funds are likely subject to other federal and state laws that require legal status .

0,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,common,"House Republicans on Monday night offered a detailed critique of what they called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ’ s “ socialist wish list ” in House Democrats ’ $ URLTOKEN trillion proposal for responding to the coronavirus outbreak . “ Speaker Pelosi unveiled legislation aimed at exploiting the COVID - 19 public health crisis by attempting to force the inclusion of a socialist wish list of policies that have nothing to do with the public health and economic emergency , ” said House Minority Whip Steve Scalise , Louisiana Republican . Under the heading of “ Union Giveaways ” : • Nullifies the White House executive orders on federal collective bargaining and codifies taxpayer - funded union official time . • Requires a labor union representative on every airline ’ s board of directors . • Multiemployer pension bailout lacking needed reforms . • Permanently raises the minimum wage to $ 15 for any business that receives federal aid for COVID - 19 . • Cancels all debt owed by the URLTOKEN Postal Service to the Treasury . Under the heading “ Green New Deal priorities ” : • Requires all airlines that receive assistance to offset carbon emissions for domestic flights by 2025 . • Includes a $ 1 billion “ cash for clunkers ” airplane program where the Transportation Department buys fuel - inefficient planes from airlines in exchange for agreeing to buy new ones . • Includes expansive new tax - credit for solar and wind energy . • Mandates how states must run elections , including the nationalization of ballot harvesting , requiring early voting , same day registration , and no - excuse vote by mail . • Puts states at risk of costly litigation if they are unable to implement these stringent mandates ahead of the 2020 election . • Requires the Homeland Security Department to automatically extend visas and work authorizations expiring within the next year , including those with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and Temporary Protected Status , for an amount of time equal to their prior visa , authorization or status . • Limits Customs and Border Patrol ’ s ability to shutdown processing centers if there is a health crisis on the border and requires CBP to assure the timely adjudication of asylums applications . • Would allow certain funding to go to sanctuary cities . • Permanent changes to who can serve on corporate boards of directors for companies that receive assistance for payroll and operating costs . • Mandatory disclosure on supply chain management . • Requires board diversity disclosure for all publicly traded companies . • Ban on all federal rulemaking including non - COVID 19 proposals ( extends 30 days after emergency ) “ in an attempt to delay the current administration from promulgating actions House Democrats disagree with . ” • Virtually rewrites the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program policy with no reference to COVID - 19 and permanently disallows rulemaking pertaining to work requirements and eligibility . • Permanent expansion of Obamacare entitlement , “ putting the American taxpayer on the hook for endless and unchecked health insurance spending and would remove all incentives for insurers to reduce the cost of health insurance . ” Mr . Scalise said the Democrats ’ bill also excludes bipartisan health - care provision in the Senate bill , including a proposal to expand telehealth access for home dialysis patients , hospice and home health patients ; and a measure to prevent a payment reduction for durable medical equipment to help patients ’ better transition from the hospital to home . “ Instead of working in a bipartisan , bicameral way to provide this immediate relief , the speaker has proposed legislation that includes highly partisan provisions while excluding key patient care provisions that would have a real impact on Americans affected by COVID - 19 , ” Mr . Scalise told his Republican colleagues .",B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote

1,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,anecdote,"Dozens of media companies received coronavirus relief loans from the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP ) over the past several months , according to data released Monday by the Small Business Administration and Treasury Department . The lending program , established by Congress in late March to buoy small businesses during the pandemic , has distributed about $ 521 billion in loans that are forgivable so long as they are used for payroll , mortgage interest , rent and utilities . Though the funding was largely intended for businesses with less than than 500 employees , some loans were claimed by major corporations like Shake Shack , prompting public backlash that led several companies to return their loans . Some media outlets also returned funding , even though they met the program ' s qualifications . Axios returned its $ URLTOKEN million loan , citing the political polarization around the program and questions over whether media outlets should accept funds from the federal government . Other media companies that received loans have kept the funding to stay afloat as advertising revenue has dried up during the pandemic . In the figures released Monday , the federal government listed the dollar range for each loan , instead of specific amounts . The list included some recipients who said they later returned the funds . Here is a list of major media outlets that received at least $ 150 , 000 from the PPP . Alaska Public Media Inc . in Anchorage , Alaska ( $ 350 , 000 to $ 1 million ) The American Prospect in Washington ( $ 150 , 000 to $ 350 , 000 ) Anchorage Daily News LLC in Anchorage ( $ 1 million to $ 2 million ) BDG Media Inc . , which publishes Bustle , in New York ( $ 5 million to $ 10 million ) Boone Newspapers Inc . in Tuscaloosa , Ala .

1,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,anecdote,"Security researchers at ESET have discovered a new ransomware called CryCryptor which has been posing has an official Canadian Covid - 19 tracing app . The ransomware emerged only a few days after the Canadian government announced its intention to back the development of a nation - wide , voluntary tracing app called COVID Alert that will be rolled out for testing in Ontario as soon as next month . CryCryptor is distributed from two websites that claim it is a Covid - 19 tracing app when in reality it is just a new ransomware family . Once all the target files have been encrypted , a notification is displayed on the device which reads “ Personal files encrypted , see URLTOKEN ” . Thankfully though , after analyzing the app , ESET researchers discovered an “ Improper Export of Android Components ” bug that allowed them to create a decryption tool . By using a simple search based on the fake Covid - 19 tracing app ' s package name and a few strings , ESET researchers discovered that the CryCryptor ransomware is based on open source code available on GitHub . The developers behind the open source ransomware gave it the name CryDroid before uploading it to the developer platform . They also attempted to disguise the project as research by claiming they uploaded the code to VirusTotal . At this time , it is still unclear as to who uploaded CryDroid in the first place but the code appeared on VirusTotal the same day it was published on GitHub . In a blog post , ESET researchers explained that there is no way the project was designed for research purposes as “ no responsible researcher would publicly release a tool that is easy to misuse for malicious purposes ” . For those who have accidentally fallen victim to CryCryptor , you can download ESET ' s Android decryption app though the security company warns that the app will only work for this version of the ransomware .",B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O O I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-testimony I-anecdote I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-anecdote I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O,https://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/technology/this-ransomware-poses-as-a-covid-19-tracing-app/ar-BB16153N
1,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,anecdote,"© Provided by Space China ' s Long March 2D rocket lifts off from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center on Feb . 19 , 2020 , carrying four Xin Jishu Shiyan test satellites to orbit . China resumed satellite launches Wednesday ( Feb . 19 ) amid the ongoing coronavirus outbreak , lofting a Long March 2D rocket in the country ' s first launch since the Chinese New Year . The Long March 2D rocket lifted off from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in the country ' s Sichuan province at 4 : 07 URLTOKEN EST ( 2107 GMT , 5 : 07 URLTOKEN local time ) , and the state - owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp . ( CASC ) confirmed the launch roughly 40 minutes after the rocket left Earth , SpaceNews reported . Aboard the rocket were four Xin Jishu Shiyan test satellites called XJS - C , XJS - D , XJS - E and XJS - F , all of which went into their planned orbits . The satellites , which were built by CASC subsidiaries , will test new technologies for Earth observations and communicating with one another , CASC said , according to SpaceNews . The ongoing coronavirus outbreak originated in the Wuhan area and has affected infected tens of thousands of people worldwide , sparking some quarantine measures in China and other countries . The launch took place just a few days after Wu Yansheng , chairman of CASC , examined Chinese launch preparation facilities to see how the workers were handling coronavirus containment procedures , such as wearing masks , SpaceNews reported . Senior space leadership ( including people from CASC ) also met on Feb . 13 to discuss lessons learned from the coronavirus outbreak and how to protect workers in the future , Space China said in a separate translated report . CASC has launched four missions in 2020 and is planning more than 40 this year . In 2019 , China performed some rocket launches at the same facility with as little as 6 hours ' separation between launches ; that ' s a very fast turnaround time compared with the usual launch pace in other countries .",B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-testimony I-testimony I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote B-anecdote I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-assumption I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-assumption I-anecdote I-assumption I-anecdote I-assumption I-assumption I-anecdote I-assumption I-anecdote I-anecdote I-assumption I-anecdote I-anecdote O,https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/techandscience/coronavirus-isnt-stopping-china-from-launching-rockets/ar-BB10g0LN
1,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,anecdote,"In a heated and contentious debate in the Oval Office last Monday morning , President Trump demanded the military put 10 , 000 active duty troops into the streets immediately , a senior administration official told CBS News . Attorney General William Barr , Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley objected to the demand , the official said . In an attempt to satisfy Mr . Trump ' s demand , Esper and Milley used a call with the nation ' s governors later that morning to implore them to call up the National Guard in their own states , the official said . If these governors did n ' t ` ` call up the Guard , we ' d have ( active duty ) troops all over the country , ' ' this official said . That same day , the Pentagon started bringing in 1 , 600 active - duty troops to bases just outside the District of Columbia . Late that afternoon , Esper and Milley were on their way to the FBI ' s Washington Field Office , where the command center for the military and law enforcement response to the protests was located , the official said . En route , they received a call to come to the White House to give the President an update . They did not brief the president , but they were asked to stay for his address in the Rose Garden and then to accompany him on the walk across Lafayette Park to St . John ' s Church . Milley had been wearing his dress uniform in the morning but changed to his combat fatigues because he knew it was going to be a long night at the FBI command center , the official said . Neither man realized the purpose of the walk was to stage a photo op in front of the church . On Wednesday morning , after two nights of peaceful protests , Esper ordered 700 troops from the 82nd Airborne Division to return to Fort Bragg , and then delivered a statement in the Pentagon briefing room that he was opposed to using the Insurrection Act to send active - duty troops into the streets . Esper was saying in public exactly what he had been saying in private to the president , but Mr . Trump was furious with him at a White House meeting later that morning , the official said . © Patrick Semansky / AP America Protests Washington Esper After the meeting , Esper reversed his decision to send the 700 troops home – not because of the president ' s anger , but because he had received reports that protesters were planning a million man march on Washington for Saturday . After another night of no violence in the streets , Esper again gave the order to send the 700 paratroopers back to Bragg and on Friday gave another order to withdraw all but 350 of the troops who had been placed on alert . The remaining 350 are members of the Old Guard permanently based at Fort Myer , Virginia , just across the Potomac River from the District , and they were placed on a lower state of alert

0,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,anecdote,"Dozens of media companies received coronavirus relief loans from the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP ) over the past several months , according to data released Monday by the Small Business Administration and Treasury Department . The lending program , established by Congress in late March to buoy small businesses during the pandemic , has distributed about $ 521 billion in loans that are forgivable so long as they are used for payroll , mortgage interest , rent and utilities . Though the funding was largely intended for businesses with less than than 500 employees , some loans were claimed by major corporations like Shake Shack , prompting public backlash that led several companies to return their loans . Some media outlets also returned funding , even though they met the program ' s qualifications . Axios returned its $ URLTOKEN million loan , citing the political polarization around the program and questions over whether media outlets should accept funds from the federal government . Other media companies that received loans have kept the funding to stay afloat as advertising revenue has dried up during the pandemic . In the figures released Monday , the federal government listed the dollar range for each loan , instead of specific amounts . The list included some recipients who said they later returned the funds . Here is a list of major media outlets that received at least $ 150 , 000 from the PPP .

0,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,anecdote,"Security researchers at ESET have discovered a new ransomware called CryCryptor which has been posing has an official Canadian Covid - 19 tracing app . The ransomware emerged only a few days after the Canadian government announced its intention to back the development of a nation - wide , voluntary tracing app called COVID Alert that will be rolled out for testing in Ontario as soon as next month . CryCryptor is distributed from two websites that claim it is a Covid - 19 tracing app when in reality it is just a new ransomware family . Once all the target files have been encrypted , a notification is displayed on the device which reads “ Personal files encrypted , see URLTOKEN ” . Thankfully though , after analyzing the app , ESET researchers discovered an “ Improper Export of Android Components ” bug that allowed them to create a decryption tool . By using a simple search based on the fake Covid - 19 tracing app ' s package name and a few strings , ESET researchers discovered that the CryCryptor ransomware is based on open source code available on GitHub . The developers behind the open source ransomware gave it the name CryDroid before uploading it to the developer platform . They also attempted to disguise the project as research by claiming they uploaded the code to VirusTotal . At this time , it is still unclear as to who uploaded CryDroid in the first place but the code appeared on VirusTotal the same day it was published on GitHub . In a blog post , ESET researchers explained that there is no way the project was designed for research purposes as “ no responsible researcher would publicly release a tool that is easy to misuse for malicious purposes ” . For those who have accidentally fallen victim to CryCryptor , you can download ESET ' s Android decryption app though the security company warns that the app will only work for this version of the ransomware .",B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O O I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-testimony I-anecdote I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-anecdote I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O,https://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/technology/this-ransomware-poses-as-a-covid-19-tracing-app/ar-BB16153N
0,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,anecdote,"© Provided by Space China ' s Long March 2D rocket lifts off from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center on Feb . 19 , 2020 , carrying four Xin Jishu Shiyan test satellites to orbit . China resumed satellite launches Wednesday ( Feb . 19 ) amid the ongoing coronavirus outbreak , lofting a Long March 2D rocket in the country ' s first launch since the Chinese New Year . The Long March 2D rocket lifted off from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in the country ' s Sichuan province at 4 : 07 URLTOKEN EST ( 2107 GMT , 5 : 07 URLTOKEN local time ) , and the state - owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp . ( CASC ) confirmed the launch roughly 40 minutes after the rocket left Earth , SpaceNews reported . Aboard the rocket were four Xin Jishu Shiyan test satellites called XJS - C , XJS - D , XJS - E and XJS - F , all of which went into their planned orbits . The satellites , which were built by CASC subsidiaries , will test new technologies for Earth observations and communicating with one another , CASC said , according to SpaceNews . The ongoing coronavirus outbreak originated in the Wuhan area and has affected infected tens of thousands of people worldwide , sparking some quarantine measures in China and other countries . The launch took place just a few days after Wu Yansheng , chairman of CASC , examined Chinese launch preparation facilities to see how the workers were handling coronavirus containment procedures , such as wearing masks , SpaceNews reported . Senior space leadership ( including people from CASC ) also met on Feb . 13 to discuss lessons learned from the coronavirus outbreak and how to protect workers in the future , Space China said in a separate translated report . CASC has launched four missions in 2020 and is planning more than 40 this year . In 2019 , China performed some rocket launches at the same facility with as little as 6 hours ' separation between launches ; that ' s a very fast turnaround time compared with the usual launch pace in other countries .",B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-testimony I-testimony I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote B-anecdote I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony I-testimony O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote O B-assumption I-anecdote I-anecdote I-anecdote I-assumption I-anecdote I-assumption I-anecdote I-assumption I-assumption I-anecdote I-assumption I-anecdote I-anecdote I-assumption I-anecdote I-anecdote O,https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/techandscience/coronavirus-isnt-stopping-china-from-launching-rockets/ar-BB10g0LN
0,Authoritie's Actions,Government's COVID Aid,anecdote,"In a heated and contentious debate in the Oval Office last Monday morning , President Trump demanded the military put 10 , 000 active duty troops into the streets immediately , a senior administration official told CBS News . Attorney General William Barr , Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley objected to the demand , the official said . In an attempt to satisfy Mr . Trump ' s demand , Esper and Milley used a call with the nation ' s governors later that morning to implore them to call up the National Guard in their own states , the official said . If these governors did n ' t ` ` call up the Guard , we ' d have ( active duty ) troops all over the country , ' ' this official said . That same day , the Pentagon started bringing in 1 , 600 active - duty troops to bases just outside the District of Columbia . Late that afternoon , Esper and Milley were on their way to the FBI ' s Washington Field Office , where the command center for the military and law enforcement response to the protests was located , the official said . En route , they received a call to come to the White House to give the President an update . They did not brief the president , but they were asked to stay for his address in the Rose Garden and then to accompany him on the walk across Lafayette Park to St . John ' s Church . Milley had been wearing his dress uniform in the morning but changed to his combat fatigues because he knew it was going to be a long night at the FBI command center , the official said . Neither man realized the purpose of the walk was to stage a photo op in front of the church . On Wednesday morning , after two nights of peaceful protests , Esper ordered 700 troops from the 82nd Airborne Division to return to Fort Bragg , and then delivered a statement in the Pentagon briefing room that he was opposed to using the Insurrection Act to send active - duty troops into the streets . Esper was saying in public exactly what he had been saying in private to the president , but Mr . Trump was furious with him at a White House meeting later that morning , the official said . © Patrick Semansky / AP America Protests Washington Esper After the meeting , Esper reversed his decision to send the 700 troops home – not because of the president ' s anger , but because he had received reports that protesters were planning a million man march on Washington for Saturday . After another night of no violence in the streets , Esper again gave the order to send the 700 paratroopers back to Bragg and on Friday gave another order to withdraw all but 350 of the troops who had been placed on alert . The remaining 350 are members of the Old Guard permanently based at Fort Myer , Virginia , just across the Potomac River from the District , and they were placed on a lower state of alert

A Computer Science and Business student has been selected for the Apple Worldwide Developer Conference ( WWDC ) 2020 after he submitted a COVID - 19 simulator for the WWDC Scholarship . This social distancing simulator attempts to show users the effects they have on public health by social distancing . Dave Jha , a student of Lehigh University in Pennsylvania , US , shared the news of his selection on Twitter . He developed a COVID - 19 Social Distancing Simulator that has the ability to toggle speed , number of people , asymptomatic conditions , social distancing , forced distancing , and a game mode . People were represented as tiny dots in the simulator . Gallery : Coronavirus ( COVID - 19 ) outbreak around the world I never imagined this would happen .
